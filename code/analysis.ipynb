SWEAT: an.Sweat from 8 'rusters' and 8 control persons was examined for its sodium concentration. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis of pilocarpine on the distal forearm. In no case did the concentrations exceed the normal upper limit for this procedure, and no difference was found between the two groups. In this way the study failed to confirm earlier reports of elevated sodium chloride concentrations in sweat from 'rusters'. Proposals of a relationship between 'rusters' and patients with pancreatic cystic fibrosis were not substantiated. Hyperhidrosis of the palms and volar surfaces of the fingers was present in all 'rusters'. This seemed to be the main cause of the corrosive tendency, and patients referred for palmar hyperhidrosis were found to produce corrosion similar to the 'rusters'. Topical application of aluminium chloride hexahydrate in a 25% solution in absolute ethyl alcohol proved effective against both hyperhidrosis and the corrosive tendency.\",\n",

Increased numbers of precipitins against P. aeruginosa were correlated with chronic lung infection caused by this species and with poor prognosis, whereas such associations were not revealed as regards precipitins against the two other bacterial species.  Increased numbers of precipitins against E. coli and B. fragilis were significantly associated with increased numbers of precipitins against P. aeruginosa.  It is suggested that this association is due to immune reactions in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased absorption of antigens from the gut.',\n",

It has been reported previously that a deficiency of vitamin A may predispose to development of increased intracranial pressure and bulging fontanelles in cystic fibrosis.  Finally, it is somewhat difficult to understand how such marked airway obstruction which produced increased intracranial pressure could occur with preservation of arterial blood gases. - Vitamin A and carotene blood levels were not determined in our cases and therefore obviously this possibility cannot be excluded, at least in two of the cases.  Dr Taussig\\'s suggestion that the improvement in the intracranial pressure in our cases was really the result of the \"unknowing\" associated administration of vitamin A and not to the improvements in the pulmonary status, as I proposed, fails to note the clinical observation that there had been a \"rise and fall\" in the bulge of the fontanel concomitantly with the increase and decrease of respiratory obstruction signs.  As to the question of the severity of airway obstruction, the clinical reversible picture of severe tachypnea with poor air entry, clear lung fields on X-ray with overdistended lungs and small heart appear most suggestive of airway obstruction in C.F.',\n",

Seven were off antibiotics, ten on oral cloxacillin, and six on i.v. triple therapy (cloxacillin, gentamycin, and carbenicillin) for at least 2 weeks.  Controls had lower concentrations (milligrams per gram dry stool) of both fat (P < 0.005) and vile acids (P < 0.025) than CF children off antibiotics. Antibiotics had little or no effect on fat but led to a striking decrease (P < 0.01) of bile acids in the triple therapy group. Concomitantly, there was reduced deconjugation of bile acids (P < 0.01) and formation of secondary bile acids (P < 0.005).  This was associated with a 5-fold increase in the percentage of bile acids found in the aqueous phase of stools and with a marked reduction (P < 0.001) of the anaerobic flora (log counts per gram wet stool) in children on triple therapy (4.3 plus or minus 1.9) when compared to controls (9.8 plus or minus 0.1), CF off antibiotics (9.1 plus or minus 0.1) and CF on cloxacillin (9.6 plus or minus 0.2).

The progressive downhill course in these patients was punctuated by recurrent symptomatic exacerbations of chronic bacterial bronchitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus, and terminated in pulmonary insufficiency, cor pulmonale and death.  COPD was complicated by minor hemoptysis in 60 per cent, massive hemoptysis in 7 per cent and pneumothorax in 16 per cent, problems rare in children.  Sinusitis was present in all those examined roentgenographically, and 48 per cent had nasal polyposis.

The doses of atropine sulfate and isoproterenol hydrochloride were based on published dose-response characteristics of the drugs.  Each day, thoracic gas volume and airway resistance were measured in a volume displacement body plethysmograph, and maximal expiratory flow-volume curves were performed before and at 15, 30, and 60 min after the inhalation. After inhalation of saline, group mean values for all pulmonary functions indicated greater airway obstruction at 15, 30, and 60 min when compared to pretreatment values.  After inhalation of isoproterenol and atropine, significant improvement (P < 0.05) was noted in maximal expiratory flows at 60 per cent of total lung capacity, specific airway conductance, thoracic gas volume, and residual volume.  Inhalation of atropine also significantly improved maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of vital capacity. Isoproterenol increased the mean flows by 8 to 46 per cent above baseline, and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 11 to 16 per cent with the maximal response at 15 or 30 min. Atropine increased mean flows by 15 to 77 per cent and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 16 to 25 per cent with the maximal effect at 30 to 60 min.  The mean response to atropine, expressed as a percentage of baseline, was always greater than or equal to that for isoproterenol.  We conclude that vagal tone, which may reflect increased irritant receptor activity, contributes to the obstructive pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis.  Inhalation of atropine sulfate will decrease the pulmonary function abnormality, but side effects prohibit its clinical usefulness.',\n",

The incidence of false- positive results was about 5 per 1000 specimens in either test. This could be reduced by 90% by determining the ratio of albumin : alpha-1- trypsin inhibitor (a ratio below 2.0 being considered as a negative result), and it could be reduced to zero by determining the ratio in subsequent faecal specimens. Three of 12 meconium specimens from infants with proved CF gave false-negative results in all 3 tests. The other 9 specimens had greater than 100 mg albumin/g dry weight and albumin: alpha-1-trypsin inhibitor ratios of greater than 3.0; in subsequent faecal specimens the ratios were over 4.0. 176 meconium specimens from elsewhere in the UK were examined and these included 23 from infants who were subsequently proved to have CF. Six of these 23 CF specimens gave false-negative results, the other 17 being strongly positive.

The thickness of the septal wall, the thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall, and the aortic dimensions were increased in those with severe disease. The dimensions of the left ventricular cavity for the population were slightly but significantly smaller than normal in systole and in diastole throughout the course of the disease. This study demonstrates that echocardiography is an effective noninvasive means of assessing the long-term changes in children with cystic fibrosis. These changes occur in both sides of the heart and appear to worsen as the disease progresses.',\n",

MITOGENS: pd.In the present study, we compared the levels of a series of cultured lymphocytic acid-hydrolase enzymes in cystic fibrosis homozygotes, heterozygotes and controls; compared the effects of three different mitogens on these levels; and studied the effect of CF vs control serum in the culture medium.  Our observations provide an entirely new interpretation for the apparent changes occurring in lymphocytic enzymes during culture of lymphocytes with mitogens, and suggest that a serum factor is present in cystic fibrosis serum that mimics mitogens in this regard.  Lymphocytic acid-hydrolases and total protein are present in higher concentrations in lymphocytes cultured for 48 hours without mitogen when CF homozygous or heterozygous serum is present in the culture media.  This appears to result from a CF serum factor that has mitogen-like activity and prevents loss of cell protein during culture.  Responsiveness of the cellular proteins to mitogens is blunted when CF serum is present in the culture media, either because the cell proteins are already maximally stimulated by the CF serum factor, or the factor blocks or modifies the action of mitogens on lymphocyte protein content.  This phenomenon is useful for detection of CF heterozygosity, and appears to reflect the genetic abnormality causing cystic fibrosis.',\n",

RESPIRATORY-FUNCTION-TESTS: mt.This study demonstrates the clinical feasibility of atraumatically measuring dynamic regional lung function with tetrapolar electrical impedance plethysmography (EIP) in the pediatric age group. A tetrapolar electrode system was used because of its ability to detect local baseline and pulsatile impedance changes, minimal electrode- tissue impedance interference, and uniform current distribution. Studies performed on 4 children 4 to 15 years old with various pulmonary diseases are presented. The information obtained on their regional ventilation and pulsatile perfusion by EIP was found to agree closely with pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scans. In one case, EIP detected pulsatile perfusion abnormalities which were not apparent in the non-pulsatile perfusion scan but were demonstrated by cineangiography. It is concluded that tetrapolar EIP can provide safe, reliable regional information about ventilation and perfusion in diseased lungs, and because of its atraumatic approach, is technically most suitable for use in children.',\n",

This resulted in an 18 percent increase in Dsb corrected for pulmonary volume. Inhalation of a bronchodilator drug was associated with relief of obstruction and a fall in the corrected Dsb in 31 asthmatic subjects but did not change either the obstruction or the corrected Dsb in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis.

Echographic recording of the pulmonary and aortic valve echogram permitted measurement of the phases of right and left ventricular systole. The ratio of the LV preejection period/LV ejection time (LPEP/LVET) and shortening of the LV internal dimension %SID was employed to reflect LV function, while RV preejection period/RV ejection time (RPEP/RVET) has excellent correlation with pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. RPEP/RVET and two other echographic measurements, right ventricular wall (RVW) and internal dimension (RVD) were compared with pulmonary function tests and clinical scores.

The antigen most commonly eliciting a positive skin reaction in cystic fibrosis patients is Aspergillus fumigatus. In six children tested to this antigen the bronchial response varied, two were negative, one gave an immediate reaction and three gave a dual (immediate and late) reaction. None of the children showed the characteristic pattern of response to exercise seen in asthmatic patients, an initial rise in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate followed by a fall of greater than 14% below the resting level. Two patients showed an abnormal rise in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate during exercise, a pattern described previously in cystic fibrosis. The results suggest that bronchial allergy, immediate or late does completely explain susceptibility to asthma, and that other factors including perhaps the type of bronchial reactivity shown by bronchoconstriction after exercise may be required. However the majority of the children tested had bronchial allergy and anti- allergy therapy such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate may have a place in the management of selected patients with cystic fibrosis.',\n",

In 74.5% of the initially successful courses the patients were recolonized within one month. Fifty-three patients were examined by audiometric and vestibular tests. Only in one patient was it possible to register a transient, high tone hearing impairment at 8000 Hz bilaterally, that might be attributed to the tobramycin treatment. It is concluded that high dose tobramycin treatment in children and adolescents with normal kidney function implies only a minimal clinical risk of adverse ototoxic effects, even after repeated courses of treatment. No nephrotoxic side-effects were found in this material.',\n",

(CF)  Relatively recent recognition of CF as a specific disease entity.  Wide range of clinical manifestations, presentation as a multisystem disease, and great natural variation in the severity of involvement of various organs.  Past difficulty in establishing a diagnosis based on sound laboratory evidence, this being largely due to the lack of a screening test that had gained wide acceptance among diagnosticians, and inaccuracies in the performance and interpretation of the sweat test.  In addition to these factors, there are a number of methodological deficiencies and questionable assumptions in several of the papers that have here been reviewed.  It may be noteworthy that the two sets of authors whose research design most closely matched being aimed at providing multiple ascertainment of cases and cross-checks of validity, have arrived at nearly the same estimated incidence of this particular disorder (1/3700 and 1/3800 respectively).  The issue of selection and diagnostic criteria is one that has important implications for epidemiologic studies of cystic fibrosis.  Particularly in a disease like CF, where the spectrum of clinical manifestations and severity of involvement is so broad, estimates of incidence will vary according to the criteria by which cases are ascertained and included.  A greater degree of uniformity in standards than has been employed in previous studies is necessary before comparisons can meaningfully be made.  There are good grounds for regarding most estimates of CF incidence to be minimum confirmed figures, and this is particularly so where the research design ensures that multiple ascertainments of the same case will be identifiable.  Higher estimates are made where several sources of error (respondent bias, generalization of hospital data to the wider population, multiple ascertainments of the same patient) are not recognised.',\n",

After incubation cells were lysed, and hemoglobins were separated by isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide slab gels and quantitated by microdensitometry. HbAic increased with time, glucose concentrations (5-500 mM) and incubation temperature (4 degrees-37 degrees C).  Low temperatures allowed prolonged incubations with minimal hemolysis.  At 4 degrees C HbAic increased linearly with time for 6 wk; after incubation at the highest glucose concentration, HbAic comprised 50% of total hemoglobin.  Insulin (1 and 0.1 mU/ml) did not affect HbAic synthesis in vitro.  In addition to glucose, galactose and mannose, but not fructose, served as precursors to HbAic.  A good substrate for hexokinase (2-deoxy-glucose) and a poor hexokinase substrate (3-O-methyl-glucose), were better precursors for HbAic synthesis than glucose, suggesting that enzymatic phosphorylation of glucose is not required for HbAic synthesis.  Autoradiography after erythrocyte incubation with 32P-phosphate showed incorporation of radioactivity into HbAia1 and HbAia2, but not HbAib, Aic, or A. Acetylated HbA, generated during incubation with acetylsalicylate, migrated anodal to HbAic and clearly separated from it. Erythrocytes from patients with insulinopenic diabetes mellitus synthesized HbAic at the same rate as controls when incubated with identical glucose concentrations.  Likewise, the rate of HbAic synthesis by erythrocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis and congenital spherocytosis paralleled controls.

SPUTUM: mi.A phenotypic characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from single sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology, pigmentation, and serotype.  Two or more isolates with different but stable susceptibilities to carnecillin, gentamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa.  Differences generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain.  O- antigen group determination with the Difco typing set showed that two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21 sputum specimens.  Nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of their parent strain.  These data suggest that cystic fibrosis patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by difference strains of P. aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed.  Alternatively, phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain.  Because of the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct P. aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis.  We recommend that several colonies of each distinguishable colony type of P. aeruginosa be pooled for the antibiogram.',\n",

In order to determine whether its beneficial mucolytic activity might be counterbalanced by a deleterious direct effect on cilia, we studied its effect on the activity of ciliated epithelium in the ferret tracheal organ culture system. N-acetyl-L-cysteine consistently caused progressive time-dependent ciliostasis at concentrations clinically employed, with complete ciliary paralysis within 8 hr. The effect was only partially reversed by the removal of the drug. Control preparations retained full ciliary activity for 3 to 12 weeks. In order to determine the active site on the N-acetyl-L- cysteine molecule, we investigated the ciliostatic effects of five of its chemical analogs. Isomolar N-acetyl-L-alanine was not ciliostatic, indicating the necessity of a sulfhydryl group for activity. Ciliostasis was independent of isomeric structure, acetylation, and chain length, as evidenced by the similar ciliostatic effects of L-cysteine, D-cysteine, 2-mercaptoethylamine, and N-acetyl-L-homocysteine.

Because of certain problems with baseline measurements and withholding of medication, it seems that the conclusion of Mitchell et al may not be well supported. - We felt justified in studying those patients with a low baseline FEV (forced expiratory volume in one second), since a subject's bronchial response to methacholine remains stable even if these is moderate fluctuation both in initial specific airway conductance and in the severity of the disease.  We feel that withholding the drug for a longer period would not have affected the comparisons.  Although there might be a common underlying mechanism in bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma and cystic fibrosis, our data showed a number of differences between the two groups of patients.

If polyadenylic acid produces only 70% inhibition of pancreatic ribonucleases at a one-to-one ratio of substrate and inhibitor, a relatively enormous amount of polyadenylic acid would have to be fed with the pancreatic extracts.

Treatment with cephalexin decreased the frequency of respiratory illnesses, respiratory illnesses requiring antibiotics, and hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses in patients initially colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Haemophilus influenzae, and also reduced colonization with these organisms.

GASTRIC-MUCOSA: de.  HISTAMINE: pd. METIAMIDE: pd.  THIOUREA: aa.The total active transport of Cl ions across the frog's gastric mucosa can be considered as: net Cl- flux (serosa to mucosa) = H+ + SSC (short-circuit current), all terms expressed as micromole cm-2 hr-1.  The net chloride flux (Hogben, 1955; Durbin & Heinz, 1958) may be divided into two fractions: an acidic one which is equivalent to the acid secreted and an electromotive one which accounts for the gastric electromotive force.  The changes in SCC can accordingly be used as a partial index to the activity of the chloride pump. Experiments were designed to investigate the effects of histamine, metiamide (H2 receptor antagonist), cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF plasma on the above parameters using the frog's isolated gastric mucosa.  The SCC and the resistance of the mucosal preparation is measured by means of an automatic SCC apparatus (de Jesus, 1977). The H ion secretion is measured by pH meter.  Results obtained (expressed as mean change (delta) plus or minus S.E. of mean) for histamine (10-4 M) (n = 10) show an initial increase of the SCC by 36.94 plus or minus 2.95 microA cm-2 and a parallel small increase in H+ output by 0.045 plus or minus 0.003 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  This initial increase in SCC is followed by a drop to a steady-state level of 23.62 plus or minus 2.23 microA cm-2 and also by a large increase in H+ secretion 2.26 plus or minus 0.22 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  These results support the work of Rehm (1961) in that histamine has an effect first on the Cl- pump and then on the H+ secretion.  Metiamide (10-4 M) (n = 12) caused a drop in the SCC by 20.16 plus or minus 2.32 microA cm-2 and also reduced the acid secretion by 2.21 plus or minus 0.14 micromole cm-2 hr-1, thus suggesting an effect on the Cl- pump as well as on the H+ secretion. Significant differences are shown (P < 0.001) between CF and non-CF plasma results.  The CF plasma (n = 8) increased the SCC by 17.25 plus or minus 2.94 microA cm-2 and H+ secretion by 2.38 plus or minus 0.43 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  Non-CF plasma caused a slight increase in SCC by 5.17 plus or minus 1.1 microA cm-2 and had little effect on the H+ secretion, 0.34 plus or minus 0.01 micromole cm-2 hr-1 (n = 8).  The effect of the CF plasma on the Cl- and H+ mechanism is of interest since in cystic fibrosis there is an abnormal increase of Cl- and Na+ in the sweat of patients (di Sant Agnese, Darling, Perera & She, 1953).\",\n",

Na transport is also reduced in the chronically ligated salivary duct of the rabbit submandibular gland (Fraser & Smaje, 1978), and because p.d. is unaffected, the ligated gland may be a useful model of this aspect of cystic fibrosis.  Here we would like to report a further similarity to cystic fibrosis; duct ligation leads to goblet cell hyperplasia which also occurs in the salivary glands in cystic fibrosis (Lev & Spicer, 1965).  Sections of the salivary duct 6 microm thick were taken at 60 microm intervals from ducts which had been ligated for between 1 and 5 weeks and from their contralateral controls following fixation by immersion.  Ligation resulted in an increase in luminal diameter by distension of the previously convoluted epithelium, but there was no significant change in epithelial surface area.  The number of cell layers appeared to have increased however and there was a proliferation of goblet cells.  The mucus in these cells was stained by alcian blue at pH 1 indicating the presence of sulphomucin.  The mean goblet cell density rose from 7.62 plus or minus 4.73 mm-2 (mean plus or minus S.E. of the mean, n = 6) in controls to 114 plus or minus 49.6 in ligated ducts.

In early pregnancy the bulk of the protein in amniotic fluid is derived from the maternal circulation, and this can obscure the more critical contribution from the fetus needed for prenatal diagnosis. 10 - 30% of amniotic fluids are significantly contaminated with maternal blood, and if the enzyme in question is present in this blood (as 4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate [MUGB] protease is), this can further distort diagnostic conclusions.

The activity of alpha-mannosidase in plasma and this pH is a composite one: both acidic alpha-mannosidase, which has a pH optimum of 4.25 and intermediate alpha-mannosidase, which has a pH optimum of 5.6 - 6.0, will contribute to the activity measured at pH 5.4.  These two forms of alpha-mannosidase are structurally and genetically distinct and have different kinetics and thermostabilities.  Therefore the total alpha-mannosidase activity at pH 5.4 and the physicochemical properties of this activity will depend upon the relative proportions of the two types of alpha-mannosidase in the sample.  The proportions of the two forms vary widely in normal plasma, especially in plasma from children. Although the data of Hosli and Vogt suggest that the total alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4 does not differ significantly between controls, CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes, they do not show whether the proportions of acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidase have changed.  An increase in the proportion of the thermolabile intermediate alpha-mannosidase in CF would be manifested as a decreased thermostability of alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4. Alternatively a mutation in the normally stable acidic alpha-mannosidase leading to a less stable form would also be reflected as a decreased stability in the activity at pH 5.4, especially if the proportion of acidic alpha-mannosidase was increased in CF.

STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS.Since it has been demonstrated that chronic administration of reserpine to rats produces CF-like alterations, we have studied the lung resistance to bacterial infections in animals treated with reserpine.  Mice of the BALB/c inbred strain were injected subcutaneously with different doses of reserpine for 7 days; after, they were submitted to an infective aerosol containing Staphylococcus aureus in a nebulization chamber.  With each pair of exposed animals, an individual value of the uncleared bacteria ratio (UBR) at 4 hours was obtained.  Reserpinized animals showed a significant increase in UBR values when compared to control mice (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 depending on the doses), suggesting an impairment of the lung antibacterial defenses.  Although pharmacological doses of reserpine produce catecholamine depletion, we can not conclude that this action upon the nervous system is the only cause of the CF-like response we detected.  In conclusion, the observed UBR decrease lends support to the concept of a reserpine- induced CF animal model.',\n",

PARAMYXOVIRUS-INFECTIONS: im.Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal or semi-lethal genetic disease in Caucasians of Central European origin, among whom it is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait at a frequency approximately 10 times that expected from recurrent mutation alone. A decreased sialic acid content has been observed in cell surface glycoproteins on cystic fibrosis fibroblasts and in numerous soluble glycoprotein preparations from cystic fibrosis homozygotes. Sialic acid residues on cell surface glycoconjugates play an essential role in the binding and infectivity of myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, including those causing pandemic influenza. It is suggested that increased resistance to these viruses conferred by similar but quantitatively smaller alterations in sialoglycoconjugate structure in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes may have provided a selective advantage to maintain the high frequency of the cystic fibrosis gene in Caucasian populations.',\n",

A stimulus for the induction of these enzymes is the retention of any kind of polymer inside the cell.  This stimulus is long-lasting and strong if polymers are intracellularly retained because of a lack of digestive enzymes.  In previous papers it has been demonstrated that the alkaline phosphatase (AIP) induction with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein discriminates between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes on the one hand and normals and CF carriers on the other hand, and a hypothesis has been proposed to explain these observations.  As predicted, more efficient inducing mixtures have since been developed; these have been used in the present study.  The first writer familiarized himself with ultramicrotechniques and then carried out double blind studies on 20 fibroblast cultures from French patients.  These findings demonstrate the reproducibility of the AIP induction and of the methods used, and they particularly underline the importance of employing the present ultramicrotechniques for a successful AIP induction.  It is likely that amniotic fluid cells behave like skin fibroblasts in this test; if this proves to be so, then the induction of alkaline phosphatase should provide a useful technique for the prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.',\n",

On the 1st day physiotherapy was performed twice; on the 2nd day no physiotherapy was performed; on the 3rd day the two periods of physiotherapy were preceded by an inhaled bronchodilator (Rimiterol).  Lung function tests included peak flow, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1.0) and residual volume to total lung capacity ratio, and were measured at the beginning of each day and at similar intervals throughout the 3 days.  Sputum volume and cough frequency were noted on day 1 and day 3.  Physiotherapy resulted in significant improvement of peak flow in the sputum producers.  However, the FVC and FEV1.0, while improving after physiotherapy, also improved on the control day when no physiotherapy was performed.  This suggests that physiotherapy may be effective in removing sputum from central large airways with resultant improvement in peak flow, but has little added effect on the more peripheral airways, whose airflow improves through the day with normal activity.  No significant effect was shown in the non- sputum producers although there was a trend towards improvement in peak flow.  A bronchodilator before physiotherapy may be beneficial in those patients who demonstrate significant reduction in airflow obstruction at formal testing of bronchodilator response, but may lessen the beneficial effects of physiotherapy in those without a positive response.  The study illustrates the importance of examining difference methods of chest physiotherapy, to find ways of improving sputum clearance.',\n",

We were impressed by the enormous variability of the pulmonary symptomatology in these children.  The question arose whether this clinical impression is supported by the finding of the thorax radiograph and the results of the lung functions tests and the blood gas measures at rest and on exercise.  From the clinical point of view, there is a possibility to make a classification of severity in pulmonary aspects of this disease.  Because of the large ranges of the score values a clear distinction of the severity could only be possible if large groups of patients were to be compared.  For the interindividual comparison the cumulative evaluation of a clinical score, the chest radiograph and the lung function tests are indispensable.  Only the continuous follow-up of these examinations allows one to notice, in time, a progressive lung involvement with its degenerative changes.',\n",

RESEARCH.This review emphasizes some of the positive accomplishments of cystic fibrosis research, some of the puzzles and some of the recent developments that have promise.  One of the major unresolved questions is the maintenance of this lethal gene at such a high frequency, perhaps because of a heterozygote advantage in the past, no longer operative at present.  Nothing is known of the chromosomal localization of the trait; except that chromosomes are morphologically normal, that it is autosomal, not sex linked and that there is no correlation with blood groups or major HLA loci.  One of the important achievements of the past many years is that we understand relatively well the pathogenesis of most clinical manifestations of CF.  The as yet unknown inherited basic defect or metabolic error of CF gives rise to two main anomalies: the electrolyte defect in exocrine sweat glands and the 'mucous secretion' abnormality.  While the results of tissue culture studies often have been conflicting and disparate, it does seem to be the consensus that the fibroblasts are affected by the basic metabolic error in some manner, and that they respond abnormally under different experimental circumstances.  Virtually all investigators have found some anomalies in biologic fluids of CF, although using different approaches and methods.  An abnormality in the function of the autonomic nervous system, which is so closely associated with the exocrine glands, has always been an attractive explanation for the generalized exocrinopathy of CF.  The search for a genetic animal model for CF has led to interesting findings.\",\n",

RECEPTORS-ADRENERGIC-BETA.Water, electrolyte and macromolecular secretion, which is affected in cystic fibrosis, is regulated by neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system stimulating the cells by binding to alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.  Therefore, a genetic disturbance in cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) response could eventually explain some of the manifold expressions of labile biochemical changes observed in CF, specially in tissue culture.  We further characterized beta-receptors in cultured fibroblasts of CF patients and normal controls and investigated isoproterenol and prostaglandin E1-mediated c-AMP response using defined culture conditions.  No significant difference was found between the two phenotypes on basal c-AMP values.  With the exception of one cell line, CF strains had 25 to 180% increased c-AMP content.  This difference is highly significant (p < 0.0025).  This statistically significant difference in response can neither be attributed to differences in dose- or time-response curves nor to differential c-AMP escape into culture medium.  Since CF cells synthesize more c-AMP than controls only in response to isoproterenol but not to prostaglandin E1, the alteration which might be responsible for the observed phenomenon is probably located proximal of the adenylate cyclase at the cells border between intra- and extracellular space.\",\n",

Groups which were characterized by the infection of the lower part of the respiratory tract had increased lysozyme level. The results obtained in the group of CF children are similar to those obtained in groups with bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis, which suggests that the observed differences are characteristic for chronic infection rather than for CF.  Although in CF as well as in bronchiectasis massive bacterial infection results in increased concentration of immunoglobulins, antiproteolytic fractions and acute phase proteins, the results seen in both groups are somewhat different.  These differences may indicate some difference in the reactivity to infection of the respiratory tract in CF in comparison to patients with bronchiectasis.  It seems conceivable that among children with CF who have very low S-IgA, chronic respiratory tract infections occur earlier and IgG response to permanent exposition to variety of antigens is less vigorous.

As a consequence of this hypothesis, one would expect cystic fibrosis patients to produce a pronounced antibody response against the intestinal bacterial flora.  The present work was therefore carried out to investigate the antibody response in CF patients and in normal persons against Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis which are present in the gut in large numbers and against the respiratory pathogen P. aeruginosa.

Such a correlation between the antibody response and the prognosis of the patients was not found as regards E. coli or B. fragilis.

Because of the high incidence of false-negative results (34%) the detection of protein in meconium is not an ideal screening test, but is the most satisfactory presently available, in the newborn period.  Because of its relative simplicity, low cost, absence of direct involvement of the parent or patient, and a high yield of positive cases, its use on a wider scale may be justified.',\n",

Bearing these facts in mind, we suspected that abnormal, over-sulphated, and strongly anionic, glycoproteins might be involved in the pathogenesis of CF.  The present study was carried out to determine whether sulphated blood-group substances occur in normal pancreatic tissue.  The distribution of sulphate over the exocrine part of pancreas does coincide with the distribution of blood-group substance previously observed by fluorescent microscopy.  We therefore find it very likely that the sulphate and blood-group substance are associated with the same glycoprotein molecule.  Since blood-group substance has been demonstrated in many secretions in man, and since high amounts of sulphate have been found in the mucous glands in CF, such a mechanism is possible in many locations and may thus offer an explanation for the multiorgan involvement in CF.',\n",

ISOPROTERENOL: pd.  LUNG: de.  PILOCARPINE: pd. RESERPINE: pd.Lung lavage samples from rats treated in a chronic fashion with reserpine had mean increases of 133, 170, and 120% in the total protein, lipid, and carbohydrate contents, respectively, when compared with those of untreated control animals, when these values were expressed in terms of body weight.  An acute single ip injection of the beta-adrenergic agent isoproterenol (10 mg) increased the glycoprotein content of pulmonary lavage fluid from control rats approximately 15-19%, but only 9-10% in those from reserpine treated rats.  By contrast, pilocarpine (10 mg), administered in the same manner, caused a 15% increase in the total protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content of lavage samples from control rats and increased these same constituents in the lavage samples of reserpine treated rats 98, 102, and 80%, respectively. The increased  total carbohydrate content in the lavage samples of the treated animals was not associated with changes in the percent distribution of neutral sugars, amino sugars, or sialic acid.  The ratio of these various sugar components did not change in the lavage samples of control or reserpine treated rats upon stimulation with either pilocarpine or isoproterenol.  The increased total lipid content fround in the lavage samples from the treated rats probably results from an increase in phospholipids.  A decrease in phospholipid content occurred in the lavage samples of reserpine treated rats upon stimulation, while the opposite was observed in those of control animals.  Chronic treatment of rats with reserpine, thus, appears to induce an enhanced production of glycoproteins in the airways and to interfere with phospholipid metabolism in the lung.  In addition, the drug treatment enhances the secretory response to pilocarpine in comparison with the responses of control animals.  The enhanced response or hypersecretion of glycoproteins is a quantitative one and does not seem to involve alterations in the ratios or distribution of the various sugar components.  This disturbance in the secretory function of the respiratory tract, a target organ which is prominently involved in cystic fibrosis (CF) together with alterations in other exocrine glands which resemble those of CF patients, makes the reserpine treated rat a useful model for further study of possible pathogenetic mechanisms in CF.  The experimental animal model for CF developed by the chronic administration of reserpine to rats has been found to have changes in the protein content of lung lavage samples, in addition to morphologic and secretory alterations in the salivary glands and the pancreas.  Further analysis of the organic composition of lung lavage samples shows that the protein, carbohydrate, and lipid contents are significantly increased after chronic reserpine administration and that the response to stimulation with pilocarpine is enhanced in the treated animals when compared to that of untreated control rats.  It therefore appears that chronic reserpine administration causes a hypersecretion of glycoproteins and changes in lipid metabolism in the respiratory tract of the rat and that, in conjunction with previous findings in other exocrine glands, these effects on lung function make the reserpine treated rat a useful tool for the study of the pathologic disturbance seen in the major exocrine glands affected in CF.',\n",

By contrast, submaxillary saliva from control rats caused a 6% inhibition of Na+ reabsorption, a 6% reduction in volume, and a 5% reduction in flow rate.

Although a slightly greater inhibition by CF serum was observed at a concentration of 10%, this is probably not significant because no difference could be detected at a concentration of 20% serum. Glucose transport in the presence of serum was sensitive to phlorizin indicating that the residual glucose transport was proceeding by the sodium-dependent glucose transport system. These findings suggest that CF serum does not specifically inhibit the sodium-dependent glucose transport system. The intravesicular space accessible to glucose was reduced in the presence of CF or control serum. Fresh CF serum was 1.4 times more effective than fresh control serum (P less than 0.01).

The magnitude of this difference (approximately 30%) is not reduced when cells are washed with lanthanum chloride after the exchange period. This difference is likely attributable to an altered capacity of one or more of the intracellular Ca sequestering organelles. Further evidence for this explanation was seen in 45Ca efflux experiments in which CF cells retained a higher percent of their initial 0-time 45Ca than did C cells late in the efflux period (P less than 0.05).

However, the changes in serum amylase values in patients with CF are on the average due to changes in the pancreatic contribution to the serum and as expressed as a mean was highly significantly different for both normal and abnormal pancreatic function.  The second important point of our paper was that this mean variation occurred in serum samples from patients with CF that had total amylase values within the normal test range.  The serum salivary isoamylase in both normals and patients with CF and PI had a higher serum salivary percent.',\n",

TRACHEA: de.A tracheal ring explant system, when used with 25% cystic fibrosis (CF) serum, displayed obvious ciliostasis. Hamster, rabbit, and guinea pig explants all had measurable decreases in ciliary activity after 24 hr of incubation in the serum. The differential response to CF serum (relative to normal serum) was greatly increased by using explants which were maintained 24-72 hr in minimal essential medium (MEM) with 10% horse serum and which were selected on the basis of optimal ciliary activity and vigor. With such a bioassay system of guinea pig tracheal explants, incubation with 25% normal serum would produce essentially no change in relative ciliary activity (score of 242 of a possible 300), whereas CF serum resulted in an 86% decrease (score of 33). Scanning electron microscopic observation indicated that the explants displaying the CF-ciliostatic effect had significant accumulations of mucous over the ciliated epithelial surface. A biochemical viability assay (dehydrogenase activity) showed no cytonecrosis when CF serum-treated tissues were compared to standard explants (10% horse serum in MEM) or control explants (25% normal human serum).',\n",

Two infants had repeated episodes of metabolic alkalosis; for one of these infants, both episodes of metabolic alkalosis occurred before the diagnosis of CF. It is postulated that chronic loss of sweat electrolytes together with mild gastrointestinal or respiratory illness may predispose the infant with cystic fibrosis to a severe electrolyte and acid-base disturbance. The lack of shock and hyperpyrexia together with the apparent chronicity of electrolyte losses differentiates metabolic alkalosis from the heat prostration syndrome, a more acute complication of cystic fibrosis.

To confirm our theory, we planned to search for additional lectin-like activities in CF serum.  Our experiments suggest that the lectin-like substance in CF blood requires IgM for its red-blood-cell-agglutination activity.  Thus, no difference in agglutination titer is observed between CF homozygotes and heterozygotes, because IgM is the limiting factor, and IgM concentrations do not differ appreciably in such subjects.  We suspect that CF homozygotes have a larger pool of free lectin in their blood than do heterozygotes, so that quantitation of this free lectin pool may distinguish between the two phenotypes.
