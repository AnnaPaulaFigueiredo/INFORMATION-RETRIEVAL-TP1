In addition, the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2 scoring systems.  Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22. The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly changed compared with matched control persons.  Notably IgG and IgA were elevated and the \"acute phase proteins\" were changed, the latter suggesting active tissue damage.  The concentrations of 3 of the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins. The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on the tissue of the respiratory tract.',\n",

Nail clippings from 1322 newborns, 22 CF patients (two of them newborns), 52 healthy controls and 22 heterozygotes were analyzed. The discrimination between CF patients and controls was found to be precise for individuals above one year of age and INAA of nail clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for CF after this age.  Heterozygotes could not be detected by the method.  During the first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values from normal newborns and those of CF children, which makes the method invaluable for early screening for CF.',\n",

SODIUM: an.Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of nail clippings was used in the development of a diagnostic method for cystic fibrosis (CF).  From CF patients and controls more than three years old, nail clippings were sampled for tests of different errors.  As a result of this study a precise collection routine was outlined. Sodium is easily washed out from nail clippings.  The risk of sodium contamination of the nails seems to be small.  The sodium distribution in the nail is inhomogeneous, and the sodium content varies also from nail to nail in the same person.  There is good evidence that the increased sodium in the nails of CF patients comes from the sweat.  There seems to be a basic \"intrinsic\" sodium level, which is about the same in the nails of CF patients as in controls. The precision and accuracy of INAA for determining sodium in nails is considered satisfactory.  It is concluded that INAA of the sodium concentration in nail clippings is a suitable method as an aid in the diagnosis of CF if a precise collection routine is used.',\n",

The one-year period prevalence rate of patients harbouring Ps. aeruginosa was 64 per cent.  In newly colonized patients and in intermittently colonized patients non-mucoid strains were predominating, whereas mucoid strains were predominating in chronically colonized patients.  The occurrence of mucoid strains, especially in chronically colonized patients, was associated with a significantly higher number of precipitins against Ps. aeruginosa than the occurrence of non-mucoid strains.  Males chronically colonized with mucoid strains presented a significantly higher number of precipitins than females chronically colonized with mucoid strains and the number of precipitins was correlated with the duration of the chronic colonization with Ps. aeruginosa in males in contrast to females.  The results are in accordance with the hypothesis that mucoid substance could be a virulence factor because it might inhibit the opsonizing effect of the precipitins on the mucoid cells and the complement dependent lysis of the cells hereby favouring mucoid strains at the expense on non-mucoid strains in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients.',\n",

The fluctuations of the bacteriology are described by additional epidemiological terms: At one or more examinations during the study (period prevalence rate), 90 per cent of the patients harboured St. aureus, 64 per cent Ps. aeruginosa (mainly mucoid strains), 64 per cent H. influenzae, 37 per cent D. pneumoniae, and 30 per cent miscellaneous other bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae.  This pattern was found in all age groups with minor age-dependent modifications, especially as regards Enterobacteriaceae.

PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS.Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders has received increasing attention during the past several years.  Rapid expansion of our knowledge of the basis of genetic disease and the development of reliable diagnostic methods have led to rapid advances in the intrauterine diagnosis of a large number of inherited disorders. Prenatal diagnosis was initially used to determine the presence of Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities and for the determination of fetal sex in pregnancies at risk for a number of severe X-linked recessive disorders.  Shortly thereafter, it became clear that the same techniques could be applied to the prenatal diagnosis of a number of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Most recently, a number of new techniques have been developed that may prove to be of great value in the prenatal diagnosis of a number of severe congenital malformations that before now could not be diagnosed prior to birth.  The goal of this review is to define the past achievements, future goals, and present limitations of intrauterine diagnosis.  The first section will deal with the general approaches used in prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders.  This will be followed by a discussion of the specific applications of the basic techniques to the intrauterine diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities and of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Approaches to prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, direct and indirect visualization of the fetus, analysis of maternal blood and urine, and sampling of fetal tissues.  Applications of prenatal genetic diagnosis include X-linked recessive disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, disorders of lipid metabolism, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, disorders of mucopolysaccharide metabolism, disorders of amino acid metabolism, and miscellaneous disorders such as cystic fibrosis.  These techniques provide some parents with methods for having children without fear of having a child with a specific deformity.  In addition to the development of approaches which will increase the number of disorders detectable in utero, the potential for treatment of genetic disorders is unlimited.\",\n",

PULMONARY-ALVEOLI: cy.As far as rabbit alveolar macrophages are concerned, the concentration of homozygous CF serum used in our experiments was even greater than the fourfold concentration which Biggar and associates state was required for normal phagocytosis.  Increasing dilutions of homozygous CF sera with either Hanks balanced salt solution or normal human serum, thus decreasing its concentration, increased the capacity of the rabbit alveolar macrophages to phagocytize and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Increasing concentrations had just the opposite effect.  Suspension of rabbit alveolar macrophages in human serum reduced their phagocytic activity, but activity was reduced more by human CF serum than by human normal serum.  This is not unexpected because high human serum concentrations are likely to be toxic to rabbit alveolar macrophages.  Because the inhibition of phagocytosis was absent when homozygous CF serum more than 24 hours old or previously heated or frozen was used and because of our observations that dilution increased macrophage phagocytic ability, we feel our data demonstrate the presence of a labile inhibitor rather than a deficiency.  Since it is well known that CF patients have normal or elevated concentrations of immunoglobulins including IgA in their sera and pulmonary secretions and respond to infection, and IgA has not been shown to be essential for alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we cannot agree that this inhibition is due to an IgA deficiency.

Closing volumes in these patients were often high enough to cause significant disturbances in gas exchange and the elevated closing volumes were quantitatively explained by the low values for elastic recoil.  The modified flow-volume test detected mild flow reduction in many patients who otherwise had normal pulmonary function tests. Loss of recoil per se did not account for the low maximum expiratory flows, since \"upstream\" resistances were high.  However, pressure-flow curves were effort-dependent at high lung volumes even in patients with severe airway obstruction, showing that time constants of emptying varied widely in these patients.

SPUTUM: an.The hypothesis that mist tent therapy decreases the viscosity of sputum by direct liquefaction of the sputum in the lower respiratory tract was tested in 6 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The first night all patients slept without the mist tent and the first morning sputum was collected for analysis.  The following 2 nights patients were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or ultrasonic nebulizer.  The early morning sputum was analysed for volume, viscosity, water content, and DNA content, an index of purulence.  There was no relation between sputum viscosity and DNA content, water content, or volume.  Furthermore, there was no consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated and the presence or absence of an 8-hour stay in the tent with either method of water nebulization.  These results therefore suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum viscosity or volume in patients with CF.  Above a sputum water content of 90%, further increases in water content do not influence viscosity.',\n",

Thirteen aetiological factors relating to mother or baby were found.  13 infants were premature, 10 had severe respiratory problems at birth.  Maternal hydramnios was present in 7.  6 babies had had exchange transfusion. The commonest findings were gangrenous volvulus and cystic fibrosis. Combined factors were often present.  The usual presentation is with bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass normal meconium.  4 cases had distended abdomens at birth.  Plain abdominal x-rays are of great diagnostic value.  Pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic but absent from early films.  Treatment is surgical.

The method was simple and reliable provided that the operator had had reasonable experience with the instrument.  One distinct advantage of the method compared with the use of filter paper was the speed with which results were obtained.

The social and emotional problems experienced by family members, particularly the patients and mothers, are reported on.  At all ages, socially embarrassing symptoms and awareness of being different create major problems for the patient.  The uncertainty of prognosis and doubts about the prospects of employment are specially relevant for the teenager. It is suggested that the patient be given ample opportunity, from early adolescence onward, to discuss all aspects of his disease, and that more appropriate provision should be made for the total care of adult patients.  Many problems, such as depression, feelings of isolation and the physical demands of constant treatment, which the parents of children with cystic fibrosis experience, are probably similar to those confronting parents of other chronically ill and handicapped children.  But special difficulties stem from the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis and from the knowledge of an eventually fatal outcome.  The roles of professional members of the medical team are touched on, particularly in relation to genetic counseling and the provision of practical and emotional support to parents.

These diseases are experiments of nature which cannot be exactly simulated in the laboratory animal, and thus may on occasions give information unobtainable from other sources.  Most often, however, they confirm that the mechanisms of absorption studied in detail in smaller mammals are probably applicable to man.  In some of these diseases there is an associated defect of transport in the proximal renal tubules as well as in the gut.  They furnish evidence, therefore, that transport processes are closely related in the gut and in the kidney, or at least that an important step in transport is identical at the two sites.

Sputum was from patients with either asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or bronchiectasis and, macroscopically, mucoid, mucopurulent or purulent.  As in the viscosity plot over this shear rate range two Zones with a junctional region can be distinguished.  In Zone 1, over the lowest shear rates, elasticity increases slowly, changes little over a \"plateau\" region and then, in Zone 2, increases sharply.  In contrast to the viscosity plot, the plateau does not show nothing.  By 0.8 c/s some samples show decreasing elasticity. Although variance between samples is wide, there is no level of elasticity characteristic of each disease or of one macroscopic appearance.  Elasticity and viscosity are correlated, most significantly at the lowest shear rates.  Asthmatic and bronchiectatic sputa resemble each other in that this correlation is still significant at higher shear rates, cystic fibrosis and chronic bronchitic sputum in that it is not.

Reduced flux of protons across the luminal membrane of epithelial cells is proposed as a general feature of exocrine gland defects.  It is then possible to describe both the cationic transport defect of the sweat gland duct and the anionic bicarbonate-secretory defect in one term.',\n",

METABOLISM-INBORN-ERRORS:  me.Since 1900 improvements in general hygiene, and the development of antibiotic therapy have enabled many of the epidemic infectious diseases, particularly those of infancy and early childhood, increasingly to be controlled.  In contrast, the morbidity and mortality of diseases of genetic origin have been little affected. The rational use of cell culture as an investigative technique in inherited metabolic disease is rooted in the simple biologic truth that, since a full complement of chromosomes is present in all somatic cells, it should be possible to detect the specific biochemical consequences of gene activity in cultured fibroblasts unless, during the process of differentiation, genes are irreversibly inactivated.  The usefulness of tissue culture in investigating inherited metabolic disease does not rest with the biochemical identification of the primary defect.  The cells in culture provide a model system of the disease, which can be used to test the possible effectiveness of therapeutic agents.  Tissue culture techniques indicated that the cells derived from patients with cystic fibrosis showed metachromasia.  Although the isolation and characterization of cystic fibrosis from cystic fibrosis serum has not been accomplished, a number of properties have been described.',\n",

Its occurrence in children of Afro-Americans is quite rare and exceedingly so in those of Oriental extraction.  Since cystic fibrosis is genetically determined as an autosomal recessive trait, and since the obligate heterozygote parent is entirely asymptomatic, the disease on its first occurrence in a given family can only be suspected by its manifestations in the patient himself.  At present there is no test available for the detection of cystic fibrosis which can be applied as a simple, practical screening test, such as is available for phenylketonuria.  Diagnostic tests are, therefore, used to confirm or refute the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis when suggestive symptoms arise or when a sibling or relative is known to have the disease.',\n",

In the newborn infant the diagnosis of homozygote (PiZZ) deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin could be established in cord serum at the time of delivery.  Trypsin inhibitory capacity (TIC) and alpha1-antitrypsin (AT) in cord serum were in the range of adult homozygotes.  By means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis exclusively, the phenotypic alleles ZZ were demonstrable.  This excludes the possibility of materno-fetal transfer of alpha1-antitrypsin.  In infant amniotic fluid extremely low antiprotease-activity and substantially no alpha1-antitrypsin was found, whereas in normal samples the TIC is 3% to 6% of the cord serum values and the AT 1.2% to 4% of cord serum concentration.  Our data suggest that a major component of TIC and AT in normal amniotic fluid derive from the fetus.  In normal meconium we detected TIC and AT in concentrations increasing proportionally to the total protein content.  The inhibitory capacity of AT in meconium expressed in mg trypsin inhibited per mg alpha1-antitrypsin however is 80% less than serum alpha1-antitrypsin.  No correlation exists with the free tryptic activity of meconium.  The AT of an PiZZ infant is clearly diminished when referred to fresh weight, whereas meconia from three cystic fibrosis newborns screened by the BM test had extremely high concentrations.  Estimation of TIC and AT in meconium is regarded as a useful approach for screening on homozygote alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency.  The exact diagnosis however can only be established by phenotyping the alleles.  In cystic fibrosis the high protein content of meconium is accompanied by increased alpha1-antitrypsin levels.',\n",

In Scotland the admission rates for coeliac disease were about twice the expected number based upon the English rates.

It was also hoped that such standardization would facilitate the more accurate study of all aspects of study of minor salivary gland secretion collected in this fashion.  From the findings, it is obvious that less minor salivary gland secretion was collected from cystic fibrosis patients than from normal control subjects, using a capillary tube test.  This may be due, in part, to an increased viscosity of minor-salivary-gland saliva in cystic fibrosis. Unfortunately, viscosity studies were beyond the scope of this investigation.  The results indicate that the relative differences between the volume of minor salivary secretion collected at a standard test site and that collected over the total lower labial mucosa are similar.  The volumetric differences in minor salivary secretion have again been found to be distinctive enough to suggest that studies be continued in this area to further refine a diagnostic test procedure for cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.

This strain has previously been shown to lose resistance to several antibodies (Lacey et al., 1973); during the last 6 months further changes have occurred in it in vivo.  Lincomycin resistance appeared after the patient had been treated with clindamycin.  This was due to mutation to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin at a locus adjacent to that determining \"inducible\" resistance to erythromycin.  Both loci are probably carried by an extrachromosomal element.  Three types of variation in the PF plasmid were observed. Alteration in production of penicillinase from macroconstitutive to microconstitutive, was not associated with any detectable change in plasmid size.  This change gave the cell an advantage in vitro, because it was associated with a faster growth rate and probably also in vivo, because the microconstitutive variants were isolated in increasing numbers after flucloxacillin therapy had ceased.

These twins offer two more examples of the edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex of infant cystic fibrosis.  In the presence of transsupplementation and the absence of hemolysis, the normal serum iron and increased peripheral and marrow iron values suggest that the anemia results from a defect at the level of hemoglobin synthesis, and that iron transport remains sufficient in the face of protein depletion. Possibly, a relative iron deficiency occurs after increased nutritional intake due to increased utilization.  Lee suggested that the hypoproteinemia is due to loss of protein in stools, but these twins suggest that the problem lies not with losses through urine or stool, but rather with failure in protein synthesis.  The possibility of hypoproteinemia secondary to liver dysfunction is attractive.  Although all liver function tests and biopsy findings were normal, this is often the case in patients with cystic fibrosis.

This did not occur in control children of similar nutritional state except in a case of twins - one with cystic fibrosis, one without - where the unaffected child's fingers began to wrinkle slightly by five minutes.

GENE-FREQUENCY.An unsolved problem in human population genetics is the high frequency of the gene for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in Caucasians. Whereas the gene frequency is probably low enough in non-Caucasians to be maintained by recurring mutation, this is not the case in Caucasians, where the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 25. In order to establish a stable genetic polymorphism for a gene where the homozygous state is lethal, some degree of heterozygote advantage must exist, and it has been suggested that C.F. heterozygotes have a higher reproductive fitness than normal individuals.  It is not possible, of course, to know exactly how stable the C.F. polymorphism is, and one cannot exclude the possibility that some form of heterozygote advantage has existed at some time in the past and no longer exists today.  We should like to suggest a possible explanation which has much in common with the generally accepted explanation for the very high frequency of the sickle-cell gene in certain populations.  In the latter case, heterozygotes have an increased resistance to a particular type of malaria.  Patients with C.F. and heterozygous carriers have been found to have, in their serum, a substance (probably a protein) that agglutinates Proteus vulgaris.  Immunological cross-reactivity between certain strains of Proteus (e.g., OX 19) and Rickettsia prowazeki has long provided the basis of a serological test for typhus (Weil-Felix reaction).  Thus it is conceivable that the C.F. heterozygote might have an increased innate ability to counter infection by R. prowazeki.  Although typhus is known in many parts of the world, it seems to have been predominantly endemic and epidemic in the temperate regions inhabited by Caucasian peoples. Some areas where it is now endemic, such as South America, first experienced the disease after it had been introduced by Europeans. This would seem to be compatible with the observed higher C.F. gene frequency in Caucasians than in other groups.',\n",

The data suggest another approach to the study of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis.  There is an apparent deficiency in essential fatty acids, and a marked reduction in serum vitamin E levels has also been reported in CF.  These conditions might be partially corrected by intravenous injection, or possibly feeding of, lipids containing essential fatty acids with concomitant administration of vitamin E.  The observed deficiency in essential fatty acids may be produced by a reduced ability to absorb these acids from the diet and this, in turn, may result in defects in membrane structure or stability.  Reduced levels of vitamin E in CF may reflect a reduced requirement for this vitamin because of the lower levels of essential fatty acids.

To the physician, fecal losses may be excessive when they cause the patient to be ill; to a parent a stool pattern that differs from that of a neighbor's infant or even a single watery stool may be too much.  New knowledge of normal gut function and the pathologic processes that may afflict the child's alimentary tract has improved one capability to diagnose and manage certain specific diseases that cause diarrhea.  Although of great interest to academicians, many of these diseases are extraordinarily rare and in most practices there is a substantial and perplexing pool of poopers in whom no specific disease can be found. Fortunately, patients in this latter group are rarely seriously ill. This article attempts to help the practitioner understand, diagnose and treat children with specific diseases known to cause chronic diarrhea.  We will speculate also on the mechanisms and management of idiopathic chronic diarrhea.\",\n",

Using this modified assay we were able to confirm that significant differences exist in the percentage of inhibition of RNa caused by CF and normal mixed saliva (47.0 plus or minus 24.8 and 18.0 plus or minus 8.3, mean plus or minus SD).

This protein has a molecular weight of 12,000.  It contains large numbers of serine, glycine, and glutamic acid residues, 0.85% phosphorus as phosphate monoester, and small amounts of carbohydrate.  Precipitation (aggregation) of CaPP occurs at basic pH values in the presence of ionic calcium and is enhanced by increasing calcium concentration, CaPP concentration, or pH. Aggregated CaPP binds calcium in molar quantities equal to the number of phosphate prosthetic groups.  Alkaline phosphatase removes all phosphate from CaPP and eliminates calcium-induced precipitation.  Studies of CaPP from CF saliva have demonstrated no electrophoretic or compositional differences from normal CaPP. Higher than normal pH values or elevated CaPP concentrations are not present in SMS of patients with CF and do not contribute to the formation of turbid SMS.  Aggregation and precipitation of CaPP in saliva of patients with CF seems to be induced primarily by elevated levels of calcium in saliva.  This precipitation may be entirely, or in part, responsible for focal obstruction of submaxillary gland ducts in patients with CF.  However, little or no CaPP is secreted in the lower gastrointestinal or tracheobronchial tracts. Therefore, CaPP does not play a more general role in the obstructive processes which characterize CF.',\n",

The CF RBC is not helpful in defining a transport abnormality in that entity.  These studies document normal intrinsic transport function in RBC of patients with CF.

The activity can be resolved into two fractions by chromatography, one of which is inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI) and the other of which is not inhibited by STI.  In plasma of CF patients, the fraction of activity inhibited by STI is reduced to approximately 30% of the corresponding fraction in control plasma.  In contrast, the fraction of activity resistant to inhibition by STI did not show any significant quantitative differences between control and CF plasma samples.  Analysis of plasma samples by electrofocusing on 5% polyacrylamide gels in the range of pH 5.0-8.0 and subsequent staining for arginine esterase activity showed qualitative differences between control and CF plasma samples.  Six activity bands could be detected in control samples, whereas five bands were detected in CF samples.  Eight samples had one type of band missing, two had another type of band missing, and one had yet another type of band missing.  All of these bands were restricted to a narrow pH zone in the center of the gel. These data are consistent with and extend our earlier reports of differences in arginine esterase activity between plasma samples of CF patients and control subjects.  The demonstration of the absence of a single band of arginine esterase activity is consistent with the absence of a specific arginine esterase isoenzyme in patients with CF.

Cells from normal volunteers and patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined during exponential growth by incubation with L-(methyl-14C)methionine and (3H)uridine. The ratio of 14C to 3H counts per minute in isolated RNA serves as a measure of the extent of methylation and was found to be similar in normal and CF fibroblasts for tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA. Hydrolyzed samples of (14C)-methyl-labeled RNA species were analyzed by two dimensional chromatography and autoradiography.  The methylated base and nucleoside compositions of tRNA and rRNA agree well with data for HeLa cells and other eurkaryote cells such as those from yeast, mouse, and chicken.  RNA methylation patterns in CF fibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed in normal cells for 4 S, 18 S, and 28 S RNA.  There is no evidence that RNA species from patients with cystic fibrosis are deficient in any methylated components.

A difference undetectable in a moderate number of subjects is probably not of pathophysiologic significance if the Ca really varies unpredictably.  Sweat Ca, however, is generally believed to vary with the rate of sweating, being much higher at lower rates, and measurements made at comparable rates might well show significant differences.

In 1971, Dolan and Gibson, in a retrospective study, reviewed the records of children with cystic fibrosis receiving chronic expectorant therapy with iodide and reported that approximately 85 percent had goiter and 15 percent suggestive clinical findings of hypothyroidism.  This study, together with the fact that the thyroid, like lung and pancreas, is of endodermal origin raised the possibility that patients with cystic fibrosis might have an underlying defect in thyroid function.

In it, we have evaluated basal thyroid function in a large group of patients with cystic fibrosis and have, in addition, observed the effects of chronic iodide administration.  The present study strongly suggests that there often occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis some derangement in thyroid hormone economy.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.  INTESTINAL-MUCOSA: me. RECTUM: me.The electrical potential difference (PD) across the rectal wall was measured in 26 patients with cystic fibrosis of pancreas (CFP) and in 18 healthy subjects. The PDs obtained in normal children were identical to those previously obtained in normal adults. A significantly greater dispersion of the values was observed in CFP. When the patients were divided into groups according to metachromasia in fibroblast cultures, the mean PD was increased only in the ametachromatic group. True enough, this observation suggests a difference between various forms of CFP, distinguished by metachromasia, and thus is a further indication of the heterogeneity of the disease. The greater abnormalities in metachromasia negative patients may, however, be due solely to the fact that these patients are more severely affected by the disease. The urinary excretion of tetrahydroaldosterone in patients was within the ranges obtained in controls, which excludes the possibility of secondary hyperaldosteronism as the source of increased PD. No evidence was provided in favour of a basic defect in the intestinal transport of Na+ or Cl minus, but K+ concentrations in faecal fluids of patients were significantly lower than in controls. The equilibrium concentration of K+ could be accounted for by simple passive diffusion, suggesting that the epithelium behaved inertly with respect to this ion in CFP.',\n",

We measured skin and rectal charges directly by connecting our reference electrode to the blood stream through an intravenous line.

The arterial-alveolar PN2 difference was nearly one half of the PO2 difference, both early in the disease and at a more advanced stage. Analysis taking into account the O2 dissociation curve and the possibility that alveolar temperature is higher than sublingual temperature suggested that all of the PO2 difference could be explained in terms of ventilation- perfusion imbalance in gas-filled units of the lung. Reduction of fractional CO uptake with increasing PN2 difference suggested that the decrease in diffusing capacity in cystic fibrosis may be explained by ventilation-perfusion inequality.

The PN2 and PO2 differences were abnormal before the standard tests of lung volume and flow, but in general, the correlation was excellent.

Those with severe cystic fibrosis had large transients as well as increased phase I on the nitrogen washout curves. These large transients were associated with increased curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve and smaller than normal flow response breathing helium. In severe cystic fibrosis, the large transients suggest sequential emptying of fast and slow spaces, which influences the shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve.

MUSSELS: ul.A phenomenon associated with the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis (CF) is the presence of a serum factor that stops or discoordinates ciliary beating.  This effect has been demonstrated by exposing freshwater mussel or oyster gill cilia, or rabbit tracheal cilia, to sera from homozygous or heterozygous cystic fibrosis subjects.  Assay reproducibility is unsatisfactory, however, and the mechanism of the effect is not understood.  Nor do we know why there may be considerable differences between the activity of tested heterozygotes and of homozygotes.  Because the ciliary assay is capricious, there is a need to understand how ciliary beating is disturbed or stopped. Since microtubules are important in the mechanism of ciliary motion, they could conceivably show alterations during the response to inhibitory substances.  There has been no ultrastructural study, however, of the effects of ciliary inhibition on the axonemal components.  Therefore, this study was designed to examine ciliary structure during the different stages of ciliary inhibition.  Rapid microtubular disappearance and reappearance occurs in the terminal cilia of the freshwater mussel Unio when exposure to CF serum causes a shock-stop reaction, and return to water allows resumption of normal ciliary beating.  In contrast, a slow-stop reaction causes distortion of cilia, asynchronous beating, and ejection of cells from the distal gill filament, but ciliary axonemal structure is preserved.  Slow-stopped cilia do not resume their beating in water. Saliva from reserpine-treated rats causes ciliary inhibition similar to that induced by CF serum.',\n",

It is often associated with urinary or hepatic pathology, the former the source of the infecting organism in the majority of cases, and presents with characteristic symptoms depending upon whether it occurs in infancy or childhood. The symptoms and signs which allow for a positive prospective diagnosis are illustrated by comparing this disease to those entities with which it is most often confused, e.g. diffuse peritonitis of other etiologies, and include a short duration of symptoms, associated urinary tract infection and an absence of free air on abdominal roentgenograms. In the past, gram positive organisms were the most common infecting agent; however, in this series gram negative bacteria accounted for 69% or the organisms. Antibiotics with a gram negative spectrum and exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy are the hallmarks of therapy, the latter replaced by abdominal tap only in the patient who satisfies the criteria for primary peritonitis and in whom an associated disease makes the risk of surgery prohibitive.',\n",

A review of this literature reveals that the nonmedical participants in this debate were preoccupied with those aims of genetics that might benefit (or threaten) society, while the physicians were concerned with the accomplishment of standard medical missions in which social aims figure only incidentally.  These missions are diagnosis, management, and prevention of disease.  The specific uses of genetic knowledge most frequently mentioned were advances in the taxonomy of disease that lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment of individual patients and their relatives, genetic counseling, and genetic screening.  The latter two, particularly screening, are preventive and represent the interface between medical genetics, especially population genetics, and society.

In this study, 18 out of 29 CF patients and 2 out of the 4 non-CF patients with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency had raised faecal bile acid levels.  In the CF patients no correlation was found between faecal bile acid and faecal fat excretion, but an inverse relation was shown between faecal bile acid values and age.

Duodenal fluid mean total bile acid concentrations were within normal limits.  Estimation of serum bile acids in these 6 patients showed that 3 patients had raised serum bile acid values.

       " '75049': 'Classification of hereditary disorders of sexual development.SEX-DIFFERENTIATION-DISORDERS: cl.We have recently proposed a classification of the disorders of sexual development based upon the presumed site of action of the abnormal gene during embryogenesis.  These disorders, which may be either genetic or nongenetic in nature, are the result of disturbances in the physiology of sexual differentiation during embryogenesis.  The purpose of this review is to summarize the current physiologic concepts of normal sexual differentiation, to review the known hereditary disorders of sexual development, and to consider briefly the implications that these mutations have for the understanding of normal sexual differentiation.  The translation of genetic sex into phenotypic sex is a complex process.  Since some 19 hereditary, single-gene determined disorders of sexual development are currently recognized that involve loci on both the autosomes and the X chromosome, it can be inferred that at a minimum 19 genes and hence 19 discrete biochemical steps are involved in this process.  At least 10 mutations result in male pseudohermaphroditism, whereas only 2 mutations are known to cause female pseudohermaphroditism.  The predominance of male type of mutation is the result of the fact that the formation of the male phenotype is actively induced by the secretions of the fetal testis whereas the formation of the female phenotype does not require secretion from the fetal ovary.  The end result of these mutations that involve the formation and action of testosterone can be similar, and it requires anatomic, endocrinologic, and genetic study of individual patients to identify the mutant genes involved.  Undoubtedly, many more as yet unidentified genes must participate in sexual differentiation.  The identification of these genes will depend on the continued delineation of new simply inherited clinical syndromes.  Any fundamental understanding of the programming of events in phenotypic differentiation will require not only the identification of the genes involved but the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which each of these genes is expressed.',\n",

Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in the technique of estimating serum AFP.  if a small number of families is analysed the proportion of affected individuals may differ from the expected. By chance some families may have all normal children whereas some may have all affected children.

Two culture phenotypes were studied in culture derived from consecutive generations in four CF families: (1) cystic fibrosis factor (CFF) in the medium of short-term white blood cell cultures assayed by a modified oyster ciliary test and (2) the three characteristics of cultured skin fibroblasts (metachromasia without alcianophilia at 0.3 M MgCl2, CFF in the culture medium and metabolic cooperation with normal fibroblasts). As CF is an autosomal recessive disorder, the family offered a test unit for determining the specificity of these cell phenotypes for the CF gene. On the basis of detecting the CF culture phenotypes in the homozygote and obligatory heterozygotes, the parents, and their segregation in consecutive generations, detection of the CF gene was not possible in the white blood cell cultures, but was possible in the skin fibroblast cultures.',\n",

Through this system an annual up-dated and corrected data base has been prepared for cystic fibrosis patients seen at U.S.A. Centers from 1966 through 1972.  From the data base, a large number of life table studies are calculated.  A study is specified by its data base, the observation period, analysis age (age year or year since diagnosis), the Centers included, and the condition of patients at birth, and possible additional factors such as sex, age at diagnosis, or race.  The annual rates of mortality are measured by a force of mortality technique.  Two techniques have been used to appraise the mortality of particular groups, graphing the cumulative survival function for the group together with the cumulative survival function for a comparative group, and calculation of mortality ratios of actual to expected deaths (by an applicable standard mortality table).  This latter approach lends itself readily to tests of significance.  For the purpose of calculating mortality ratios, two standard tables have been prepared on the basis of the 1972 Data Base and the 1966-1972 observations.  The first of these standard tables is for use with age year studies, and the second is for years since diagnosis studies.  The paper comments on the number of mortality studies by calendar year, by sex, by condition at birth, by age at diagnosis, and of survival from diagnosis of patients diagnosed in 1966-1972.  The calendar year studies indicate an improvement trend in the survival experience from 1966 to 1972 but a change may be occurring.  The study by sex exhibits a higher female mortality.  The 7% of patients who have meconium ileus at birth show a significantly higher first-year mortality, and a somewhat lower survival rate thereafter even if the first year of life experience is excluded.  Mortality data for groups specified by age at diagnosis are given.  For patients diagnosed during 1966-1972, there is some indication of better survival than for patients diagnosed prior to 1966.

Diurnal variations in cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion were observed in subjects from either group, and peak levels of cyclic nucleotide excretion were generally observed during the period of 0700 to 2100 h. Excretion rates (mumol/day) of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP increased significantly with age. When cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP excretion rates were normalized for urinary creatine, or body weight, the values declined significantly with age in both groups of patients.

This was related to the frequent occurrence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. The 173 strains were divided among 11 Homma serotypes. A single Homma type (type 8) capable of mucoid growth comprised 104 (60%) CF strains. Eight serotypes were detected in 77 strains from 48 CF patients in one hospital; three strains were detected in one hospital CF unit; and two strains were detected in each of five hospital CF units.

These P. aeruginosa strains dissociated in vivo as judged by mucoid and nonmucoid colonies on primary culture plates and continued to dissociate during subcultures. Both colony type were the same serotype. The tendency to regard colonial phenotypes (mucoid, nonmucoid, rough) as separate strains was erroneous. Repetitive typing with the two systems gave better results than a single system. The mucoid P. aeruginosa strain is probably spread from patient to patient, rather than acquiring its mucoid characteristic de novo in the CF patient.

The AFP present in different species have similar physicochemical properties and often have common antigenic determinants. Their study, both in health and disease, has provided a useful model for the understanding of other phase-specific antigens and the activation of the genes which control their synthesis. In the human fetus, the level of AFP falls with increasing maturity. The more sensitive methods of detection have disclosed that this fetal protein persists in trace amounts throughout life and its level increases in maternal blood during pregnancy. The principal sites of synthesis are the fetal liver and in some mammals, the yolk sac splanchnopleur. In humans as well as in mice and cows, it is notable that the synthesis of AFP is increased in liver cancer cells and that high levels of this protein are present in serum. Elevated values of AFP have also been detected in human subjects with undifferentiated tumours of the testis and ovary. A fall to normal levels has been noted in cases of complete remission after surgery and a return to high levels in patients who develop metastases. In some patients with hepatitis a temporary rise in the level of AFP has also been observed.

The frequency distributions of salt taste sensitivity for patients with cystic fibrosis are given. Normal siblings and control patients did not differ statistically, and they were combined into a single control group for analyses.  The patients with cystic fibrosis did not differ as a group from the normal subjects in salt sensitivity.  There were, however, two children with cystic fibrosis with taste sensitivities well below those observed among the normal children.  No age or sex differences in sensitivity were observed.  The taste sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis did not correlate with the Shwachman and Kulczycki rating of the severity of their disease.  Of the seven children who had determinations of sweat electrolytes at the time of taste testing, three failed to excrete sufficient amounts for measurements.  Patients with cystic fibrosis, as a group, were not found to have more sensitive taste acuity than normal.  This corroborates the findings of Wotman and associates and strongly suggests that a general abnormality of the taste system is not routinely symptomatic of cystic fibrosis.  Henkin and Powell hypothesized that extremely acute taste is related to elevations in the concentration of electrolytes in sweat.  This seems unlikely since the patients given sweat tests in the present study all had the high levels of sodium and chloride characteristic of cystic fibrosis, yet all had taste sensitivities in the normal range.  Wotman and associates suggested that perhaps the severity of the disease accounts for the appearance of hypersensitivity in the chemoreceptive systems.

The results show that there was a lowered content of linoleate (18:2) and arachidonate (20:4) in C.F. erythrocyte membranes, and the total essential-fatty-acid content was significantly lower than either control group.  There was no significant difference in the concentrations of the other major fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, and oleate) and we could not observe any striking alteration in the concentration of any of the minor fatty-acid components of the membrane.  It would thus appear that the overall fatty-acid pattern in C.F. erythrocyte membranes is altered only by a diminution in those fatty acids which are of dietary origin.  The fact that there was considerable overlap between the C.F. and control data makes it rather unlikely that the fatty-acid profile closely reflects the biochemical lesion of the disease.  When the essential-fatty-acid levels of the C.F. samples were compared with the Schwachman clinical scores of the patients, there was a surprisingly poor correlation (r = 0.49) which was not statistically significant.  The correlation with the nutritional part of the clinical score was equally low.  Diminished essential-fatty-acid content is often observed in many acute illnesses.

GENES.Mr Stuart and Dr Burdon speculate on the possibility that the high frequency of the cystic-fibrosis gene among Caucasians may be due to the heterozygotes having some advantage in biological fitness over normal homozygotes.  They suggest that this might be due to increased resistance to typhus, once endemic in Europe, on the basis of the well-known immunological cross-reactivity between the causative organism, Rickettsia prowazeki, and certain strains of the species Proteus vulgaris, which is agglutinated by sera from cystic-fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.  However, there is no evidence that this agglutination is an immunological reaction.  It appears microscopically to be associated with disorganisation and inhibition of the bacterial flagellae leading to clumping of the organisms.  As such it is probably analogous to the effect on cilia of rabbit trachea and oyster or mussel gills.  The cilia factor, although associated with IgG, is now known not to be IgG itself and may well be the C3a component of complement.  These and other observations, such as those on salivary and sweat gland secretions and on sodium flux, suggest that all these phenomena are membrane rather than immunological effects.  Although it is possible that a Proteus flagella antigen could also be the binding site for the cilia factor, this seems improbable.  An alternative hypothesis is that heterozygotes for the cystic-fibrosis gene have increased resistance to tuberculosis.  This would meet the requirement of a common disease recently endemic in Europe at least as well as typhus, and is suggested by indirect evidence from a family study demonstrating a significantly lower incidence of tuberculosis among the parents of cystic-fibrosis patients than among parents of controls.',\n",

Nursing care study: Sally--a child with cystic fibrosis.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: nu.  PEDIATRIC-NURSING.Fibrocystic disease is a common disease of childhood and the pancreas is abnormal in 90% of these cases.  There is fibrosis with atrophy of the exocrine parenchymal tissue, but islet cell tissue is rarely involved.  Mucous glands throughout the body are grossly distended and they secrete an abnormal viscid mucus.  Sweat glands appear normal, but they secrete sweat with an abnormally high concentration of electrolytes.  A characteristic feature of the disease is the widespread chronic bronchiolitis.  This is due to the Staphylococcus aureus which grow best in a salt-rich medium. The pathology of infertility.INFERTILITY-FEMALE: pa.  INFERTILITY-MALE: pa.In most series of infertility patients, approximately 40 to 60 percent have no discernible cause for infertility.  No wonder that those working with this condition tend to seize upon any demonstrable tissue abnormality as related to the infertility.  The use of fallible diagnostic tools may lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.  In studies of the accuracy of dye injections to demonstrate tubal patency by roentgenogram the large errors introduced by these methods were emphasized.  Between 30 to 40 percent of tubes found blocked by using a single dye examination and using the criterion of \"filling but not spilling\" into the peritoneal cavity, or with apparent obstruction at the uterotubal junction, were subsequently found to be patent.  Similar data were offered by others.  Lesions with less obvious and demonstrable causal relationship to infertility, such as pelvic adhesions and endometriosis, are more difficult to judge as to their etiologic relation.  These are assessed in discussions of male and female infertility.',\n",

INTESTINAL-DISEASES: co.From a historical view cystic fibrosis (CF) has been considered a disease of the pancreas which results in maldigestion and loss of fat, and nitrogen in the stool.  A number of early synonyms included congenital steatorrhea, pancreatic infantilism, and pancreatic fibrosis.  The concern of the pediatrician in the late 1930's and early 1940's was to distinguish nonfatal celiac disease from fatal cystic fibrosis.  In 1954, Shwachman presented clinical and laboratory features that distinguish these two entities.  Today one is not justified in making a diagnosis of celiac disease without a confirmatory small intestinal biopsy coupled with a normal sweat test.  A number of gastrointestinal complications in cystic fibrosis are examined: meconium ileus, intestinal obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency, lactase deficiency, intestinal impaction, intussusception, rectal prolapse, growth retardation, excessive appetite, cirrhosis and portal hypertension, gallbladder problems, and diabetes.  The article closes by recording the indications for the sweat test.\",\n",

HETEROZYGOTE.  HOMOZYGOTE.We have developed a standardized biophysical assay for the rapid detection of individuals homozygous or heterozygous for cystic fibrosis (C/F). The assay employs isoelectric focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels to analyze microliter quantities of whole serum for the presence of a C/F factor protein and for deletions in a group of proteins called proteins B, C, and D (Fig, 1). A pH 5-10 gradient is used (Fig. 2) and each sample is screened using a serum volume which contains 300 g immunoglobulin G (IgG). Individuals homozygous or heterozygous for C/F are distinguished from normal unaffected individuals on the basis of the presence of a C/F factor protein band (Table 1). Heterozygous carriers for C/F are distinguished from C/F homozygotes 75 percent of the time, on the basis of a deletion in either band B, C, or D (Table 2). On the basis of screening 65 patients with cystic fibrosis, 61 heterozygous carriers for C/F, and 105 normal control subjects, it was concluded that no obvious correlation existed between either sex, age, or severity of the disease in the individual C/F patient, and the absolute presence or absence of the C/F factor. In addition, no correlation existed between sex or age and the presence of the C/F factor or deletions in proteins B, C, and D in the individual heterozygous carrier for C/F or normal control subjects. Analysis of serum samples from 68 patients with a variety of other diseases, many with clinical symptoms resembling those seen in the patient with cystic fibrosis (Table 3), indicated that the C/F factor protein described in this study appears to be diagnostic for C/F genotypes, with the possible exception of patients with certain types of leukemia.',\n",

The mean total proteolytic activity in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-half the mean total activity in control subjects and heterozygotes. The mean proteolytic activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor in plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis was approximately one-third that of control subjects and heterozygotes. The relationship of arginine esterase activity to proteolytic activity was investigated. The pH optimum and action of reversible and irreversible inhibitors were similar for both activities, suggesting that the arginine esterase activity and proteolytic activity represent similar catalytic entities. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the basic defect in cystic fibrosis may reside in the deficiency of a proteolytic enzyme which results in the accumulation of the various cationic macromolecular \"factors\" described by other investigators in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The demonstration of a deficiency of proteolytic activity as assayed by the hydrolysis of protamine, a cationic polypeptide, could explain the presence of ciliotoxic cationic protein or polypeptide factors in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis and may, in some unknown manner, be related to the clinical manifestations of the disease.',\n",

GLUCURONIDASE: an. MYELOPEROXIDASE: an.  NEUTROPHILS: en.  PEROXIDASES: an.The ability of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA)-treated normal serum and of cystic fibrosis (CF)-affected and carrier sera to promote the release of lysosomal enzymes from sensitized human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) was assessed through the measurement of beta- glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activity after exposure of these cells to the various test sera. This study was initiated to extend the analogies between preciliary dyskinesia factor (pre-CDF), separated from the cell-free media of cultures derived from CF homozygous and heterozygous individuals, and C3a anaphylatoxin. The extent of lysosomal degranulation of human PMN exposed to fresh untreated sera of each of five controls, seven CF homozygotes, and eight heterozygotes, as expressed by the amount of beta-glucuronidase releases, was 7.84% (+/- 0.934) for control sera, 14.01% (+/- 1.79) for CF-affected sera, and 10.61% (+/- 1.43) for heterozygous sera. The difference between CF homozygotes and control subjects is significant (P less than 0.0001), as is the difference between CF- affected and carrier individuals (0.001 less than P less than 0.005) and between control subjects and carriers (0.001 less than P less than 0.005), when beta-glucuronidase. However, the differences between control subjects and CF heterozygous individuals are not significant. Treatment of these sera with 1 M EACA gave values for beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase release which are slightly reduced when compared with those obtained with fresh, untreated samples. EACA apparently reduces the activity of beta-glucuronidase released from PMN. Amicon filtration studies of these serum samples demonstrated that degranulating ability and the presence of cilicary dyskinesia, as assessed by rabbit tracheal bioassay, are not always associated. Therefore, the relationship between pre-CDF and the degranulator activity in native CF-affected and carrier sera is unclear, in part because of the limitations inherent in the test systems employed.',\n",

Serum protein concentration was similar in the three groups. Regardless of the units used to express activity (milligrams of protein or milliliters of serum) or whether or not samples were dialyzed against water or phosphate buffer, mean serum GR in CF was greater than in control subjects (P less than or equal to 0.002) in all series over several years. Under the above assay conditions no difference in serum GR between control subjects and carriers was detected. Calculated and assayed values of combined control and CF sera agreed as did expected and observed 50% activity in 1:2 sera dilutions in CF, control subjects, and carriers. Addition of FAD to incubation media did not effect enzyme activity in the three groups. Differences between CF and control subjects persisted after dialysis in membranes permitting passage of molecules of approximately 12,000 mol wt or less. These findings would tend to exclude the effect of extraneous serum factors in explaining the differences between CF and control subjects. The percentage of initial GR activity after four days storage (0-4 degrees) was significantly greater in CF than in control subjects (P less than 0.025). The effect of heparin on serum GR was recorded as the percentage of activity after incubation with heparin vs. activity in the standard assay for individual subjects. The effect of incubation with 5 mug/ml heparin on serum GR activity was greater in control subjects than in carriers (P less than 0.0005) and CF (P less than 0.0005). Mean serum GR activity in CF and carriers was unaffected by heparin, whereas mean activity in control subjects was decreased. In no control was the percentage of initial activity with heparin greater than the mean of CF and carrier groups. Only 3 of 20 CF and 4 of 20 carrier individuals had percentages lower than the control mean. The CF and carrier distributions were clearly different from the control distribution. Serum GR was determined in seven non-CF individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Activity in the COPD was different from CF and no different from control subjects. In none of these controls or COPD was serum GR as great as the CF mean. Serum GR in no CF was as low as the mean of control subjects or COPD. It is concluded that serum GR activity is greater in CF than in control subjects, carriers, and non-CF COPD subjects; that the difference in activity is not attributable to an extraneous serum factor, that the activity difference is not secondary to chronic respiratory disease; that in comparison with control subjects, GR from CF serum behaves differently after storage; and that serum GR from CF and carriers behaves differently from control GR in the presence of heparin.',\n",

We have, therefore, investigated aspects of complex saccharide synthesis and secretion by such cells compared with fibroblasts derived from heterozygous (HZ) parents and from normal (N) children. The main glycosaminoglycans produced by skin fibroblasts  during in vitro culture were hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfates, and dermatan sulfate-like materials. Using double-label experiments with D-[3H]- or [14c]glucosamine and analyzing the products by ion exchange chromatography, it was shown for five CF, two HZ, and four N lines that these polysaccharides were secreted into the medium in approximately similar proportions to each other. Moreover, experiments in which three CF, nine HZ, and three N lines were grown in log phase for up to 5 days in the presence of [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine indicate that, during such a period, CF fibroblasts do not secrete complex carbohydrates at rates significantly different from N or HZ cells.

Polyamines were also analyzed in exocrine fluids, and although none could be detected in either CF or control sweat or saliva, significant amounts of spermine and spermidine were present in all samples of bile and duodenal fluids. It thus seems likely that the biliary route is a significant pathway in the human for excretion of polyamines. The observation that polyamines are excreted in considerable concentrations via the bile in children may be of interest in view of the reports of elevated urinary polyamine concentrations in neoplastic states.

The diagnosis of CF in each patient was delayed because they did not have pancreatic insufficiency. The diagnosis of CF was documented by the typical pulmonary involvement and elevated sweat sodium and chloride levels in all cases and a positive family history in six of the ten patients. Two patients were diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis before the diagnosis of CF was made, thus indicating that acute pancreatitis may be the presenting complaint in the young adult with CF. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was based on the presence of severe abdominal pain, usually with vomiting, tenderness in the mid- epigastrium, elevated serum and urinary amylase and serum lipase. Attacks were precipitated by fatty meals, alcohol ingestion; postcholecystectomy and tetracycline administration. In some patients no precipitating event could be elicited. Intravenous secretin- pancreozymin stimulation tests revealed a diminished bicarbonate secretion with little effect on the secretion of the zymogen enzymes. A mild attack of pancreatitis occurred after secretin-pancreozymin stimulation. The endocrine pancreatic function tested in four patients was normal as revealed by the glucose tolerance tests and determinations of serum insulin, growth hormone and free fatty acid. Transduodenal pancreatograms were performed in three patients; one showed a normal pancreatic duct, one showed duct obstruction and in the third patient a beady type of narrowing was found.

The time of occurrence of the peak serum concentration was similar in both groups and the total urinary recovery of dicloxacillin was normal or increased in the CF patients, suggesting that the intestinal absorption of the drug was unaffected by the disease.

The sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis fell within the normal range.

Apparent hypersensitivity to taste stimuli could have resulted from the adapting effects of the relatively high level of sodium in the saliva of children with cystic fibrosis. If the contaminating effects of saliva are removed, children with cystic fibrosis yield, on the average, a taste threshold identical to that of normal children.

However frustrating and tantalising the outcome of research into the basic defect has been so far, the ultimate answer is likely to be astonishing in it simplicity.\",\n",

RESPIRATORY-THERAPY.Inhalation therapy can be divided into two types, intermittent aerosol therapy which is used to administer medications over brief periods and mist tent therapy which is used for prolonged periods of treatment.  The present state of knowledge of the basic defect of cystic fibrosis makes it impossible to give hard and fast guide lines for the use of inhalation therapy.  Much depends on the individual experience of the physician and the degree of pulmonary involvement of the individual patient.  Response to bronchodilators can be assessed relatively easily, assessment of mucolytics and antibiotics is difficult.  Antibiotics can be useful in helping to clear infection in those patients with early disease, as judged by clearing of pathogens from the cough swab or sputum.  In patients with chronic cough and large volumes if purulent sputum with positive culture from gram negative bacteria, the cultures never become negative and only in the occasional patient can definite clinical benefit be claimed. A few severely ill patients have dramatically improved when this therapy has been introduced, and the patients are convinced of the benefit of this treatment.  It is of course impossible in this disease, with such a varying clinical course, to prove scientifically that the inhalation therapy was the reason for this improvement.',\n",

During this admission, the opportunity can be taken to review the daily physiotherapy regimen with the patients and their parents.

It is easy to calculate the proportion of the population who are carriers from the birth frequency of the disease.

       " '75163': \"Physiotherapy for children with cystic fibrosis.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: th.  PHYSICAL-THERAPY.The importance of regular efficient postural drainage cannot be emphasised too strongly.  Most parents of pre-school and primary school children are young enough to be physically able to play a major role in the routine physiotherapy treatment.  The parents will require a great deal of support and encouragement from the physiotherapist, who must be ready to organise professional physiotherapy at crisis times in the family as well as in the event of an exacerbation. Medical management of cystic fibrosis.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: th.The manifestations of cystic fibrosis make it a complex disease, in the management of which the respiratory physician, the microbiologist, the gastroenterologist and last but not least, the psychologist, all are or should be involved.  About 1 in 10 babies with cystic fibrosis are born with acute intestinal obstruction due to plugging of the small intestine with very sticky meconium. Diagnosis is made by the test for excess salt in the sweat, and although possible very soon after birth, it is easier to carry out at about three weeks of age when the baby sweats more freely.  The great majority of children, if not treated, tend to suffer progressively more frequent chest infections or chronic chest infections.  The reason for the tendency of the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis to become colonised by harmful bacteria is not known.  Most cystic fibrosis children absorb carbohydrate normally, but only about 50% (range 45% to 80%) of the protein and fats they eat.  The only other major problem for which any active measures may be required is the occurrence of fibrosis of the liver in about 5% of these children. Children with cystic fibrosis should be brought up from the beginning to be like other children. Cystic fibrosis in adolescents and adults.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: th.With improvement in the treatment of children suffering from cystic fibrosis and increase in the average survival to about 17 years of age, many more patients with this disease are now coming under the care of thoracic physicians.  In nearly every patient, broncho-pulmonary disease is the major problem.  Pneumothorax is encountered in about 15% of the older patients and some of these occur bilaterally.  A few patients develop refractory airways obstruction and then a trial of steroids is justifiable.  Most patients with cystic fibrosis also require treatment for their pancreatic insufficiency.  Diabetes mellitus is more common in cystic fibrosis than in the normal population.  Analysis of sweat is essential for diagnosis.  The psychological stresses imposed upon patients and their families are very great. Emotional problems in cystic fibrosis.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: co.  STRESS-PSYCHOLOGICAL.The emotional distress associated with cystic fibrosis is considerable.  From the moment of diagnosis, delayed or not, the parents' problems multiply and for the most part these problems are at first only vaguely comprehended.  Many parents embark on the long haul of caring for their child in almost total ignorance of the disease and its implications.  The fact that the disease is inherited is of outstanding importance to the parents.  The basis of genetic counseling in the disease is the explanation of recessive inheritance.  Even when genetic counseling has been given effectively and the parents have decided to have no further children, the family planning problem is not yet solved.  The physiotherapist is also necessarily concerned with the emotional state and behaviour of the child.  Except in the latest stages of this disease the child's emotional distress is not directly related to the discomfort of his symptoms.  Over-protection by parents is understandable but it is important to persuade them that it is undesirable.  Perhaps the most difficult questions of protection arise in relation to the child's knowledge of his own disorder.  Cystic fibrosis is a miserable disease and the cause of much distress, emotional and otherwise.\",\n",
       " '75167': 'Cystic fibrosis.CYSTIC-FIBROSIS.Cystic Fibrosis (fibrocystic disease of the pancreas) is a common inherited disease which, to date, still has a fatal outcome.  The diversity of clinical manifestations and pathological findings has added further to the mysterious nature of the disease, as have the tantalizingly conflicting results of biochemical, physical and experimental studies in many laboratories of the western world.  One of the most constant clinical observations is the viscosity of the secretion of the mucosal glands in the respiratory and alimentary tracts, in the ducts of the biliary system and in the pancreas.  In approximately 10 to 15 per cent of all patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the earliest manifestation, meconium ileus, occurs in the neonatal period.  In the remaining 85 to 90 per cent of affected infants the symptoms generally become evident within the course of the first year of life.  The lung symptoms tend to dominate the clinical picture in the vast majority of untreated patients and will ultimately decide the outcome.  The lower respiratory tract is not the only part involved: nasal polyps and the accumulation of viscous secretions in the paranasal sinuses with subsequent bacterial infection are not unusual.  Pancreatic deficiency is present in the vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis and consists of a gross reduction or complete absence of exocrine secretion.  Although some histological damage has been seen in the neonatal period in infants suffering from meconium ileus, in general the full-blown picture of extensive cirrhosis, with portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, and severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhages from oesophageal varices, is seen in the older child and adolescent. Screening of the newborn to enable the institution of protective measures before lung complications arise has been attempted with various techniques.  Management includes diet and pancreatic enzyme replacement.  The treatment of pulmonary disease is the most important aspect of care in patients with cystic fibrosis, and its prevention is priority number one in the over-all management.  The outlook for the child born with cystic fibrosis depends to a large extent upon the avoidance, or delay until adult life, of the two complications that threaten his existence: cor pulmonale and cirrhosis of the liver.',\n",

Moreover, the efficacy of therapy has been difficult to evaluate for several reasons: the lack of a suitable animal model for therapeutic experimentation, the protean manifestations of the disease, the natural variations in its severity, the prolonged periods of observation that are required by its very chronicity and frequently the lack of satisfactory clinical parameters by which to score response.  Stated in its simplest form, the treatment of cystic fibrosis is directed towards the long-term control of salt loss, malabsorption and bronchial obstruction, the management of several complications of the disease and the establishment of a positive therapeutic environment that minimizes anxiety and depression.  The purpose of this review are to help the pediatric practitioner gain security in his day-to-day management of children with the disease and to advocate an effective working relationship between the practitioner and a regional cystic fibrosis or pediatric pulmonary center for long-term patient management.  Problems in diagnosis, treatment of salt loss, the prevention and treatment of malabsorption, the prevention and treatment of bronchial obstruction, the prevention and treatment of certain complications, and the psychosocial support of the patient and family are discussed.',\n",

PRENATAL-DIAGNOSIS: mt.The intrauterine detection of genetic disorders represents one of the exciting advances in medicine.  The major emphasis in this chapter will be a detailed review of the newer approaches toward antenatal detection of congenital malformations and hemoglobinopathies as well as an overview of the experience and problems of antenatal detection for chromosomal aberrations and inborn errors of metabolism. Approaches to prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, visualization of the fetus, and fetal blood sampling. Prenatal detection of genetic disorders has become a reality.  The area is evolving so rapidly that the major indications for intrauterine diagnosis have substantially changed within the past year.  Prior to this time, maternal age, previous Down's syndrome, inborn errors of metabolism and X-linked recessive disorders were the primary criteria, with approximately 85% of the cases being used for cytogenetic analysis.  Within the past year, in a number of laboratories, about half of the referrals for amniocentesis have been for central nervous system defects.  Certainly with the development of technics for fetal blood sampling, this distribution of the frequencies of indication may, once again, change substantially. Most probably for the next few years cytogenetic abnormalities and neural tube defects will be the most common indications for amniocentesis.  Amniocentesis will continue to be offered to many patients with inborn errors of metabolism and probably will be available for monitoring of hemoglobinopathies and other disorders of fetal blood as well as for accurate knowledge of the health of the fetus.\",\n",

POLYMORPHISM-GENETICS.Prior genetic studies of the human pancreatic amylase (Amy2) locus have been directed principally to the electrophoretic analysis of serum and urine, on the assumption that these fluids receive negligible contributions from the salivary (Amy 1) locus. In support of that assumption was the observation that the isozyme bands were lacking in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a postpancreatectomy patient. We have examined the sera of 97 patients having cystic fibrosis and find normal levels of serum amylase. On electrophoresis, three-quarters of the cystic fibrosis patients have a pattern (F- pattern) not observed in normal sera. The pattern is characterized by the absence of Pa 1. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the F-pattern is of salivary origin and is unmasked in cystic fibrosis by the absence of a pancreatic contribution. The normal serum pattern is considered to be an admixture of salivary and pancreatic amylase. On the assumption that duodenal fluids might more closely reflect the pancreatic (Amy 2) locus, electrophoretic studies were performed on 148 normal individuals and 37 individuals with cystic fibrosis. Electrophoretic phenotypes in duodenal aspirates are more complex than previously reported in studies of urine and serum; presumably because of the higher concentrations of amylase in the aspirates. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the phenotypes observed in duodenal aspirates also reflect admixture of pancreatic and salivary amylase. This recognition of pancreatic and salivary admixture in sera fortunately does not alter our prior understanding of the genetics of the Amy 2 polymorphism. The extensive studies which led to the delineation of the Amy 2 polymorphism were essentially based on the presence or absence of a variant band which proves now to be outside the zone of admixture.',\n",

This analysis divides the vital capacity into segments of air and assigns a transit time to each segment. The characteristics of the distribution of these transit times are used as measurements of pulmonary function. The quantities were compared with the forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, ratio of 1-sec forced expiratory volume to vital capacity, peak flow, forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity, maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of the vital capacity, specific airway conductance, and arterial PO2 of these patients. The standard deviation of the transit times was the most frequently abnormal. The mean transit time had the largest range of values in terms of its own standard deviation, and it was the best single estimate of over-all lung function because it correlated almost equally with large and small airway function. The coefficient of cariance of transit times was specific in detecting abnormality of small airways and was as sensitive in the detection of minimal lung disease as the standard deviation of transit times.',\n",

Because of the increasing adolescent and adult population of patients with cystic fibrosis and their psychosocial, employment, and treatment needs, this review, whenever possible, will emphasize aspects pertinent to older patients.  No known biochemical or structural defect will account for all the pathophysiologic phenomena of cystic fibrosis. Thus, the definition of the disease rests on the clinical findings; cystic fibrosis is a syndrome, and not yet a disease.  Incidence figures for cystic fibrosis are necessarily minimal.  The best diagnostic efforts currently available fail to detect all those who die at a young age or who have mild symptoms.  Several pieces of evidence indicate that cystic fibrosis is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait.  An autosomal recessive inheritance for cystic fibrosis suggests a discrete biochemical or structural defect.  To date no single lesion has been proved to provide a unifying hypothesis for the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis.  Exocrine gland dysfunction, mucociliary transport, immunology, ciliary factors and transport mechanisms are discussed.  The manifestations of cystic fibrosis involve many organ systems and the pattern of presentation is variable.  Respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and sweat gland manifestations are discussed.  There are at least 3 possible approaches to screening for cystic fibrosis: sweat testing, evaluation of pancreatic function, or detection of some product of the defective gene.  Prenatal diagnosis and heterozygote testing, diagnosis in adults, and diagnostic problems are also examined.  Treatment includes prevention, pulmonary therapy, and gastrointestinal therapy.

Four lysosomal hydrolases involved in the breakdown of the carbohydrate side chain were assayed using artificial substrates. The fifth enzyme, aspartylglucosamine amido hydrolase, which cleaves the linkage between this side chain and the peptide backbone, was assayed with natural substrate.

These differences between normal (N) and CF secretions were as follows: protein, 1.25 plus or minus 0.51 (N), 1.75 plus or minus 0.35 (CF) (P < 0.02); and amylase, 58 plus or minus 18 (N), 80 plus or minus 19 (CF) (P < 0.001).

These included four phosphoproteins (PP), serum albumin, an acid phosphatase-containing fraction, amylase, and an unidentified protein referred to as PI-7.1.  Together, these proteins comprise greater than 75% of the total protein in the secretion.  Differences in individual protein concentrations (milligrams/milliliter) resolved from normal and CF secretions, respectively, were as follows: PP2, 0.02 plus or minus 0.01, 0.03 plus or minus 0.02 (NS, not significant); PP3, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.05 plus or minus 0.03 (NS); acid phosphatase fraction, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.12 plus or minus 0.07 (P < 0.05); amylase, 0.09 plus or minus 0.04, 0.27 plus or minus 0.16 (P < 0.01); and pI-7.1, 0.04 plus or minus 0.02, 0.13 plus or minus 0.08 (P < 0.02).

In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically, one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief: only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age.

With the advent of antibiotic therapy, pancreatic enzyme replacement, extensive physical therapy and generally improved medical treatment, many patients now survive to adulthood.  Clinical manifestations in CF vary from patient to patient and may include pulmonary disease, malnutrition, pancreatic insufficiency and defective ion transport. The most reliable laboratory method for diagnosis of CF is testing for elevated sweat electrolyte levels.  Estimates of the incidence of CF vary from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 3500 among white populations of mid-European heritage.  The disease is rare in black populations and almost non-existent in Orientals.  Since 1967 there has been an intensive search for a circulating factor or factors which may be directly or indirectly responsible for the malfunctions manifest in this disease.  Sweat factors, serum factors, metachromasia, bioassay variations, and properties of the ciliary inhibitor are discussed. Several groups working in CF research have centered their attention on the serum complement system.  Agglutination and mucus factors, transport studies, enzyme studies, and prenatal diagnosis are also examined.',\n",

To investigate Spd and Spm distribution amoung blood components as a possible cause of the abnormality, blood was fractionated using Rabinowitz's glass bead technique and Boyum's Ficoll-Hypaque method. Free (unconjugated) polyamines were  extracted with perchloric acid and quantitated on an amino acid analyzer. In controls, mean +/- SEM concentrations in nmoles/10(9) cells of Spd and Spm, respectively, were 1.02 +/- 0.08 and 0.894 +/- 0.28 for erythrocytes; 126 +/- 31 and 357 +/- 105 for lymphocytes; 36 +/- 16 and 240 +/- 33 for granulocytes; and less than 0.5 and less than 0.5 nmoles/ml for plasma. When converted to the concentration in whole blood, it was found that greater than 90% of Spd and over 70% of Spm was associated with erythrocytes. While the higher cellular concentration in leukocytes was not unexpected, the fact that Spd and Spm in whole blood were primarily associated with erythrocytes was a new finding. Comparison with controls revealed that the Spd/Spm ratio in both whole blood and erythrocytes was significantly higher in the group of cystic fibrosis patients.\",\n",

However, we must emphasise that the functions of active immunocompetent cells may or may not be impaired, depending upon the antigens to which such cells are sensitised.  Since comparative cells from age-matched controls and from blood donors did not show such sensitisation to those antigens to which the cystic fibrosis cells were sensitised then there is no doubt that the normal function of these immunocompetent cells in the patients with CF is indeed impaired. When one considers that steroids are known immunosuppressants it is certainly not surprising that treatment of the CF patients with prednisolone caused a decreased sensitivity of these sensitised CF cells to the antigens.  Indeed, therapeutic concentrations of steroids were able to reduce the ability of sensitised spleen cells and of lymph-node cells to destroy target cells in vitro.  Apart from this inhibition of sensitised cells by steroids, 90% of sensitised lymphocytes were killed when prednisolone 1 mg/l was present during the sensitisation phase.  In addition it was observed in man that if cortisol or prednisolone was given two hours before abrading the skin, then there occurred a marked reduction of emigrations of both mononuclear cells and polymorphs into the area, thus inhibiting the mobilisation of macrophages.  We believe that the situation with regard to steroid therapy and inhibition of migration of leukocytes from CF patients is similar.',\n",

These changes are suggestive of tissue response to injurious foreign protein. Furthermore, the fact that normal sera pronounced the same kind of effects (but greatly reduced in extent) strengthens the view that these effects result from the immunologic response of the host organ to foreign antigen.

This inference is derived from the known positive correlation between canalicular bile flow and bile acid excretion that has been found to occur in all species this far examined, including man.

LUNG: pa.The autopsies of 82 patients with cystic fibrosis were reviewed with respect to pathologic changes in the lungs and their respective prevalence among different age groups. Although bronchitis, mucopurulent plugging, and bronchopneumonia were almost universally present among children of all ages, epithelial metaplasia and bronchiectasis were rarer among infants and progressively more prevalent in older age groups. Emphysema was absent in patients under two years of age and affected 11 per cent of the patients two to six years of age and 40 per cent of the patients older than six years, but was never of a severe degree by the point count method. Pulmonary hemorrhage, although uncommon, was usually associated with prominent arterial vessels in walls of bronchiectatic airways. Quantitative assessment of bronchial glands revealed Reid indices significantly higher in patients with cystic fibrosis when compared to noncystic fibrosis patients, but there was no increase in these indices with the age of the patients. Glandular hypertrophy, predominance of mucous acini within glands, and goblet cell hyperplasia of the bronchial mucosa all suggest an explanation for the copious mucous secretion of patients with cystic fibrosis.

Instead of viewing the current state of CF research as chaotic, perhaps we should say in a positive way that the diversity of ideas stimulates thinking, and in the process of sorting out the primary defect, a wide spectrum of pathophysiologic changes will be recognized.  Recently a positive-charged polypeptide associated with immunoglobulin G has been identified which may be responsible for the ciliary dyskinesis effect of CF serum.  This material should demonstrate the same properties when bound to immunoglobulin G from control sera.  It would be interesting if it were identical with the basic protein recently found only in the serum and IgG fraction of CF patients and carriers.  Further work may identify how the polypeptide affects cell membrane surfaces, and whether a defective peptidase, perhaps an arginine esterase, fails to break down the polypeptide.

MODELS-BIOLOGICAL.To geneticists, cystic fibrosis, perhaps the most frequently encountered genetic disease among Caucasians of European origin, presents an enigmatic dilemma on various levels.  Those problem areas which complicate our understanding of this disease include methods of diagnosis, ascertainment, and analysis and interpretation of data. In spite of an apparently clear-cut mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive), several conceptual difficulties exist in the acceptance of this formal transmission pattern.  The most pressing problem of all, perhaps, is the population genetics of CF.  The fact that a lethal gene may be maintained at such elevated frequencies and restricted to given population groups represents a seemingly genetic paradox.  Our aim is to review some of the problems encountered in a genetic study of CF and to propose a theoretical model which may help in their elucidation.  Topics discussed include problems of diagnosis, ascertainment, and data analysis; family studies and inferences as to the mode of inheritance; population studies; and a proposed model for the inheritance of CF.  The main tenet of this model states that CF is determined by dominant alleles at two autosomal loci, with interaction between them.',\n",

WATER: me.It has been recognized that the levels of water and electrolytes are deranged in many, if not all, of the exocrine secretions of cystic fibrosis patients.  The sodium and chloride levels in serous secretions from CF patients are elevated.  In contrast, the more protein-rich or mucoid, isotonic secretions (viz, from the pancreas and tracheobronchial mucus glands) are found to have sodium concentrations near normal or even somewhat decreased.  However, these secretions have significantly reduced water content.  The abnormalities in hypotonic secretions appear to rise from a decreased Na+ reabsorption in the ducts.  The low water content of the isotonic secretions of CF patients appears to result from decreased secretion of water and electrolytes.  Early studies on tracheobronchial secretions from CF patients led investigators to suggest that the primary defect may be a decrease in the levels of water and monovalent ions.  In an attempt to provide a unifying hypothesis, it has been suggested that an increased calcium concentration in the various exocrine secretions leads to a \"hyperpermeability\" of the mucus linings and thus to an excessive loss of water and small ions. The concentration of calcium in exocrine secretions appears to follow the concentration of proteins and especially the mucous glycoproteins.  It was suggested that calcium may be an important factor in the increased viscosity and insolubility of CF mucus. Organic ions are also potential perturbants of macromolecular structure.

The second principle is to ensure that the chosen antibiotic reaches the site of infection.

An analog of thymidine, BUdR, produced varied effects on the growth kinetics of the three genotypes.

The activities of thymidine kinase and the participation of the exogenous and de novo pathways in the synthesis of TMP were found to be approximately the same in all three genotypes.

Electrophoretic separation was achieved on polyacrylamide disc gels with subsequent sectioning of the gel columns. The amylase content in international units per liter (IU/L.) was obtained for each section by the insoluble blue starch substrate method. The mean total serum amylase of the CFP patients with PI was significantly lower than the control group. A highly significant decrease was found when the pancreatic isoamylase was considered alone. The salivary isoamylase level remained essentially the same. Three patients with CFP but without PI demonstrated higher than normal pancreatic amylase values in the serum. These patients may be in an early stage of a progressive involvement of the pancreas in which there is an increased release of amylase. This method of electrophoretic separation and quantitation of the serum amylase is sensitive and efficient and allows the simultaneous processing of multiple specimens.

By optical and scanning electron microscopy, a sequence of structural changes is observed after incubation with cystic fibrosis serum; this sequence does not occur with normal serum. The earliest changes involve swelling of the goblet cells, with subsequent discharge of mucus onto the epithelial surface. This is followed by disruption of the normally rapid and synchronized ciliary activity. Mucus gradually extends over the surface entangling cilia. Finally, some shedding of ciliated cells occurs from the epithelium. These findings suggest that factors in cystic fibrosis serum cause discharge of mucus leading to a disturbance of the normal ciliary activity in the rabbit lung.

In testing 200 normal meconiums with a negative albumin test we noted 3 positive tests for lactase.  These 3 patients did not have C.F.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: me.In an effort to determine whether increased permeability to calcium ions could explain the cystic fibrosis-serum ciliary dyskensia factor response in the tracheal test system, we selectively increased the membrane permeability of the tracheal epithelium to calcium ions by adding calcium ionophore A23187 to the tracheal culture medium. These studies determined that calcium ionophore A23187 in culture medium produced a change in mucociliary function in the tracheal test system indistinguishable from that promoted by C.F. sera.  These investigations, which are now being extended to include the ultrastructural alterations induced in the epithelium of the rabbit tracheal bioassay system, point to an important role for calcium as a cofactor in the production of the C.D.F. response generated by the C.F sera.  The C.F. serum substance seems to act at the cellular-membrane level, promoting membrane-permeability changes (at least with respect to calcium) in the rabbit tracheal test system. Such a mechanism would not necessarily result in a net physiological imbalance of calcium in the rabbit tracheal system but only local changes in calcium concentration that would subsequently alter secretion and microtubular function.  Since C.F. serum, like sweat and saliva from these same patients, can promote ionic fluxes, perhaps there is a common factor in all these body-fluids which is related to the basic defect in C.F.  It is tempting to speculate that such a factor produces a membrane-associated phenomenon that may be generally representative of the in-vivo C.F. disorder and as such may reflect the nature of the cellular and glandular abnormalities of the disease.',\n",

The possible in vivo role of ciliary dysfunction in the pathogenesis of the disease is of particular clinical interest.  Since an in vitro ciliary dyskinesia factor had been previously demonstrated and pulmonary complications are the hallmark of CF, yet clearance in most of our clinically stable CF subjects was relatively well maintained, this suggested to us that a mucociliary transport abnormality might be present intermittently.  In order to explore this further, we designed nasal mucociliary clearance studies to determine whether CF serum might exhibit MCT inhibition in vivo. From these studies, we concluded that there was a substance(s) in CF serum which had the capacity to slow MCT.  Whether this effect is on the cilia themselves or via overproduction of normal or abnormal mucus is not known.',\n",

During the past few years, technical means have been sought whereby the rates of mucus clearance within individual airways can be measured.  In this laboratory, we have developed a relatively noninvasive technique for measuring mucociliary tracheal transport rates.  We measured MTTRs in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis.  The MTTRs did not correlate well with the degree of pulmonary disease in these patients.  The measurements of MTTR would suggest that a deranged mucociliary clearance mechanism is not a necessary condition for patients with CF.

A number of abnormal humoral factors have been found in cystic fibrosis.

Because more than 90 per cent of patients with cystic fibrosis die of progressive pulmonary involvement, complicated by infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (or both), the question of immunologic deficit is frequently raised.  Extensive investigations have shown the immune system in cystic fibrosis to be intact. Studies regarding pulmonary ciliary clearance and bacteriology are also outlined.  Despite extensive investigations, the basic defect of cystic fibrosis is still unknown.  What then is the explanation of the two defects in homozygotes that lead to most clinical manifestations - the sweat electrolyte defect and the abnormality in physiochemical behavior of mucous secretions?  The former is satisfactorily explained by a sodium-reabsorption-inhibitory factor present in sweat and saliva of patients.  As for the mucous-secretion abnormality, the effect of the increasing calcium concentration in decreasing the solubility of glycoproteins suggests that this mechanism might be responsible for the precipitation and obstruction of organ passages, which gives rise to most symptoms in cystic fibrosis.

Therefore, the thyroid, like other organs of endodermal origin (lung and pancreas), may be involved in cystic fibrosis.  Thyroid function should be examined in all children with cystic fibrosis, and if iodides are administered, replacement doses of thyroid hormones should also be given to prevent hypothyroidism. - A recent review of cystic fibrosis referred to the report by Chandra et al. that the serum level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or heterozygotes who bear the CF gene.

PEPTIDE-HYDROLASES:  df.A protein with an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.48 was found to be deficient in plasma from most cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and obligate heterozygote carriers of CF as compared with normal control plasma. Purification of the protein with a pI of 5.48 from normal plasma was performed using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE- cellulose and CM-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-200- gel filtration, starch block electrophoresis, and Sepharose 4B gel filtration. The purified protein migrated as a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and displayed a single arc on immunoelectrophoresis against polyvalent antiserum to whole human serum. Results from various techniques used in its characterization indicate that this protein is a fragment of alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M) which is derived from alpha2M by proteolytic cleavage of intact alpha2M subunits. Quantitation of alpha2M levels in plasma indicated no significant differences between levels of alpha2M in CF homozygote, obligate heterozygote carrier, or normal control plasma samples. Quantitation of arginine esterase activity in plasma treated with cloroform and ellagic acid indicated that both the total arginine esterase activity and that fraction of arginine esterase activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) were decreased in most CF homozygote and obligate heterozygote plasma samples relative to normal control values. The results of this study indicate that plasma samples from CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygote carriers for CF show deficient proteolytic cleavage of alpha2M as compared with normal control plasma, and suggest that a structural abnormality in alpha2M or a deficiency in plasma proteolytic activity may be responsible for this deficiency in proteolysis.',\n",

EPITHELIUM: cy.The purpose of this investigation was twofold: (1) to identify and characterize the enzymatic ATP hydrolysis system of epithelial cilia, and (2) to develop a quantitative, biochemical test for the ciliotoxic cystic fibrosis (CF) factor based on inhibition of ATP utilization by ciliary preparations. Our rationale for selecting this system for CF factor analysis relates to the tight and essential mechanochemical coupling of functioning cilia. Using rabbit tracheal epithelium as the source, a high molecular weight (greater than 200,000) ATPase was identified, partially purified, and extensively characterized. The properties of this protein were similar to those observed in previous studies of others with flagellar and ciliary dynein (the motility-associated ATPase) isolated from microorganisms. Analysis of the pH profile revealed a broad range of high enzymatic activity between 6.5 and 9. Studies with potential cation activators showed that the enzyme is activated equally by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ in equimolar concentrations. No activation occurred in the presence of Zn2+, Na+, H+, or Na+ plus K+ and the effect of Mg2+ or Ca2+ was not inhibited by Na+, K+, or Na+ plus K+. The enzyme hydrolyzed Mg2+- containing solutions of UTP, CTP, and ADP at 51-54% the rate of ATP dephosphorylation, whereas Mg-deoxy-ATP was hydrolyzed 79% as effectively as ATP. Using a newly devised, analytical technique with [gamma-32P]ATP as the substrate, the ATP hydrolysis of various ciliary preparations from rabbit trachea and oyster gill (including motile suspensions) was monitored in the presence of sera from CF homo- and heterozygotes. Reproducible rates of ATP dephosphorylation averaging 27 nmol/min/mg protein were demonstrable with homogenates of ciliated epithelium. None of the test systems evaluated, however, were capable of demonstrating CF-related differences in ATPase activity or ATP utilization.

Some mucous secretions also show an elevation in calcium concentration. Using purified rat intestinal goblet cell mucin as a model mucin, we have investigated the effect of millimolar additions (1-25 mM) of CaCl2 on the physical properties of the mucin. Isotonicity of incubation media was preserved in order to mimic in vivo conditions. CaCl2 (8-15mM) caused a 15-33% decrease in viscosity, no change in electrophoretic mobility in acrylamide gels, and a 20-30% decrease in solubility of the mucin. Solubility changes were reversed by the addition of EDTA (20 mM) to incubations. Insolubility was also produced in incubations of mucin with a mixture of soluble intestinal contents (NaCl washings). These findings strongly suggest that the mucin became smaller and more dense as calcium was added, a process most probably achieved by loss of intramolecular water.',\n",

In saliva, this factor is associated with alpha-amylase. Removal or addition of the factor by dialysis does not affect the alpha-amylase catalytic activity of CF or control (normal) saliva. Crude preparations of the dialyzable factor from CF saliva are ciliostatic. Alpha-Amylase- catalyzed starch hydrolysis from both CF and control saliva was found to be insensitive to hydroxyalkylamine inhibitors so this method could not be used to detect differences in CF and control amylase. Since another carbohydrase, mammalian debranching enzyme, is much more sensitive to inhibition, the effect of the isolated crude factor on this enzyme was determined. The mean values for percentage of inhibition of debranching enzyme activity by fractions obtained from saliva of CF patients, obligate heterozygotes, and control subjects are: 32% (27 samples), 13% (21 samples), and 6% (11 samples), respectively.

As the proportion of oleates increases and that of linoleates decreases, erythrocyte membrane interference with the formation of intracellular oxyhemoglobin increases and arterial oxygen pressure decreases. The physical-chemical basis for these changes seems to be that oleic and linoleic acid differ in their ability to undergo reversible oxygenation in response to changes in oxygen pressure. The oxygen complex of linoleic acid dissociates at relatively high pressures, whereas that of oleic dissociates only at low pressures.

The diagnosis of CF is usually established by the presence of chronic obstructive lung disease and/or gastrointestinal dysfunction, together with elevated levels of sweat electrolytes (chloride > 60 mEq/liter), markedly diminished duodenal pancreatic enzyme concentrations, or pathologic changes in tissue.  Family history may occasionally be helpful.  The metabolic basis of CF is unknown.  The classic stereotype of the CF patient is an infant with a chronic cough, diarrhea, and growth failure.  Improved medical care is enabling many of these patients to reach adulthood, and increased diagnostic suspicion is resulting in identification of the disease in more adults.  Based upon analysis of over 11,000 cases of CF reported during the year 1974 by 119 Cystic Fibrosis Centers, the National Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimated that the probability of an individual with CF surviving to age 20 was approximately 39%. Although most of these adults are currently under the care of pediatricians, the development of medical, psychiatric, surgical, or obstetric complications may necessitate the involvement of other professionals.  A joint study of cystic fibrosis in adults conducted by Duke Medical Center and the NIH has shown that the majority of affected adults, including those diagnosed early in life, are married and work full- or part-time.  Many manifest few if any symptoms until relatively late in life.  Since this study was retrospective, the reported frequencies of the clinical findings tend to underestimate, in all instances, the actual incidence in the population studied. The reported incidence of CF in the United States has been conservatively estimated at 1:2,000 live births.  If all adults with clubbing, infertility, and other symptoms were evaluated for CF, the true incidence would certainly be higher.',\n",

Furthermore, the role of the polyamine, spermidine, and its products of metabolic degradation on glucose transport were investigated, and a relationship to the pathogenesis of membrane dysfunction in cystic fibrosis was postulated. Glucose transport in everted rat jejunal rings was used in the study. Results were expressed as 3-0-14C-MDG concentration ratio between the intracellular (ICF) and the extracellular fluid spaces (ECF) of the jejunal rings at the end of a 60 min incubation period. The mean ratio obtained from incubations of the rat jejunal rings in medium consisting of Krebs-Ringer- bicarbonate buffer and the labeled sugar was considered as 100% uptake. When plasma or serum, with or without spermidine, was mixed with the medium in a volume ratio of 1:3, a decrease in the active uptake of 3-0-14C-MDG was observed, expressed as percent inhibition. Percent inhibition of 3-0-14C-MDG uptake obtained when the rat jejunal rings were incubated in normal plasma was compared to that obtained with plasma from cystic fibrosis genotypes. It was found that: 1) plasma from 25 homozygous children had greater inhibitory effect on glucose uptake than plasma from 26 normal children; 2) plasma from 9 heterozygous women had greater inhibitory effect than that from 6 normal women; 3) the inhibitory effect of plasma from 3 homozygous children was not influenced by dialysis; 4) the inhibitory effects of paired plasma and serum samples from 9 homozygotes were comparable; 5) spermidine added to the incubating electrolyte solution did not affect glucose transport; 6) the addition of spermidine to reaction mixtures containing normal plasma potentiated the inhibitory effect; and 7) mixing and incubation of fresh bovine serum with reaction mixtures containing plasma from homozygotes decreased the inhibitory effect. The predominant inhibitory effect of plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for the CF gene appears to be related to a nondialyzeable molecule(s). It does not seem to reflect the presence of high plasma glucose levels in cystic fibrosis nor to be the result of competitive inhibition between sugars. It does not seem to be the result of sodium or other electrolyte differences. A similar inhibitory effect is acquired by normal plasma after the addition of spermidine. On the other hand, plasma from CF homozygotes loses its inhibitory effect after incubation with fresh bovine serum. These findings may indicate that products of metabolic degradation of spermidine are responsible for the inhibitory effect of glucose transport and suggest the possibility of a role in abnormal polyamine metabolism in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.',\n",

In 4 of the experiments examined topologically (SEM), the CF sera (either heterozygous or homozygous) stimulated the production of mucus that was found in close association with the cilia. The association of excessive mucus with the cell surface could be responsible, in part, for the well-known inhibition of ciliary activity by a factor in CF serum. In 3 additional SEM experiments involving shorter treatment times, very little difference could be observed between homozygous CF, heterozygous CF, and normal serum-fraction-treated oyster tissues. In parallel experiments, ultrathin sections of gill tissue were examined by means of TEM. Those samples that were responsive, as determined by TEM, displayed several characteristic features, including enlarged and partially exuded goblet cells, altered mucus structure along with twisted and matted cilia.

Characterization and comparison of fractions containing the CFCI were carried out by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis confirmed previous molecular weight estimations of 4,500 to 11,000 for the CFCI and provided an estimate of the number of proteins present in the fractions. Low molecular weight proteins from serum and media were combined with IgG preparations. No specific binding to IgG by the media fraction containing the CFCI could be demonstrated by the techniques employed. There was decreased binding of the low molecular weight serum fraction containing CFCI to native IgG molecules from cystic fibrosis patients as compared to IgG from normal individuals. However, IgG from CF individuals demonstrated increased binding of the cfci- containing low molecular weight serum fraction after gel filtration in the presence of guanidinium chloride. This suggests: 1) that very low concentrations of CFCI are present in media fractions; and 2) that native CF IgG cannot bind the low molecular weight CFCI fractions to the same degree as native IgG from normals or CF IgG that has been dissociated from non-covalently bound components.',\n",

In addition, information demonstrating a correlation between a biochemical abnormality and disease severity was observed. The differences observed in inhibition by saliva from both CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes may occur as the result of 1) interference with electron transfer from organic fuel molecules to molecular oxygen or 2) interference with the mechanism responsible for generating the biochemical reducing power necessary for multiple biosynthetic reactions.',\n",

In these latter instances, the media were inactive in the bioassay, but became active when mixed with purified IgG. In all instances, CDF activity was eliminated by the addition of anti-IgG. We have separated a low molecular weight fraction, between 1,000 and 10,000 M.W., from CF sera and culture media which is inactive in the bioassay until IgG is added. Presumptive and indirect evidence indicates that this fraction behaves similarly to the complement derived anaphylatoxin C3a. In addition, we have found activity in sera from CF patients and, to a lesser extent, carriers that induces degranulation of cytochalasin-B- treated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Since this activity appears to be in a different molecular species from that containing CDF, we postulate that the primary defect in CF is the deficiency of an enzyme whose substrates include a family of membrane-active molecules.',\n",

In addition, sera from most obligate heterozygotes lack another protein (bland B, C, or D) that is commonly found in sera from most normal and cystic fibrosis individuals. A standardized, biophysical assay is described that employs isoelectric focusing for the detection of both CF homozygotes and heterozygotes based on the analysis of whole serum for the presence of the gamma CF factor and bands B, C, and D. Results of analyzing sera from selected CF patients by isoelectric focusing indicated that there is a general correlation between the amount of the gamma CF factor and the clinical severity of the disease.

Alkaline paranitrophenylphosphatase activity was divided between the cell surface and interior. Substrate competition experiments indicated that substrate specificities for adenosine monophosphatase and paranitrophenylphosphatase activities were different. Adenosine monophosphatase activities of 2 control and 2 cystic fibrosis strains fluctuated similarly during the cell culture cycle. The apparent Km values relative to adenosine monophosphate were similar in all strains.

Results showed that it was possible to detect precipitating antibody in the sputum, and the rate was increased when both methods were used.

Strains originating from chronically infected CF patients with many precipitins against these bacteria did not differ with respect to serum sensitivity from strains originating from intermittently colonized CF patients without P. aeruginosa precipitins. Compared with normal sera, CF sera showed similar or higher bactericidal activity against a panel of P. aeruginosa strains. In this respect, any difference between CF sera with precipitins and CF sera without precipitins against P. aeurginosa was not found.

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: px.Studies have shown that children with chronic illnesses are more prone to develop secondary handicaps in the areas of educational achievement, behavior, and psychological maladjustment than are 'normal' children.  Besides his physical symptoms, the child with a chronic illness must endure prolonged hospitalization, psychological stresses, decreased activity, and is often denied opportunity for skill practice and peer group activities.  All these factors result in an overall decrease in sensory stimulation which could impair perceptual-motor functioning as well as the child's ability to successfully adapt to his disease.  Therefore, the purpose of this research was to obtain a general idea of the perceptual-motor or sensory integrative development of children with CF, to determine if there is, in fact, a need for sensory integrative treatment in the care of these children.

Operative mortality in meconium ileus is not reduced to 25% from 70%.  N-Acetylcysteine effectively cleanses the bowel of tenacious meconium plugs when directly injected during laparotomy. However, Mucomist enema alone generally does not suffice.  Selected cases have been treated successfully with hyperosmolar Gastrograffin enema.  Several screening tests, based on the increased albumin concentrations present in the meconium, are available for CF.  The Boehringer-Mannheim test strip is favored, and yielded no false positives in 69,000 tests of meconium.  However, 4 of 60 neonates who subsequently proved to have CF had false negative tests.  A pathognomonic elevation of sodium and chloride concentrations in the sweat collected by pilocarpine iontophoresis remains the definitive diagnostic test.  Bile acid malabsorption occurs in CF but not in celiac disease.  The authors postulate that the presence of maldigested materials or the absence of pancreatic enzymes interferes with bile acid absorption.  The defect disappears with pancreatic extracts.  Substitution of medium-chain triglycerides for dietary long-chain fatty acids reduces steatorrhea in CF.  However, the positive effect of MCT on weight gain is transitory.

Studies comparing reproductive outcome of heterozygotes with reproductive performance in the general population or in special control groups have been done on several occasions. These studies, however, are known to be heavily biased, on the one side by the fact that ascertainment of heterozygotes through affected offspinrg will tend to underestimate the relative frequency of smaller families, and on the other side because of the inadequacy of census data for comparison and the biases inherent in selection of control families.

Some patients are particularly prone to exhibit this variability and in them a single sweat test is almost valueless.

The problem of the 'grey area' of uncertainty is aggravated by the heterozygous state which is also associated with a sweat sodium in this range.

Despite much research and several promising leads there is no completely reliable test for detecting heterozygotes, nor a test for the identification of the affected homozygous fetus in utero.  Attention is being focused on the value and the means of screening newborn infants.  Pilot studies carried out in the past six years have indicated two main possibilities.  Firstly, the examination of meconium for excess albumin, refined to include immunoelectrophoretic estimation of the albumin alpha-1 antitrypsin ratio, disaccharidases, and lysosomal enzymes.  A second approach is based on the work with a chloride-sensitive electrode, which has been modified recently to give greater precision in measurement of neonatal sweat electrolytes. While the tests available are reasonably accurate, collaborative trials and respiratory could improve their efficiency still further. Nevertheless, any screening test is presumptive only, and there must be an adequate back-up service with a specific validated diagnostic test.',\n",

Two patients did not undergo the procedure and served as control subjects. All patients were characterized as having varying severity of pulmonary involvement. Large central airways were severely obstructed, and older patients had more trapped gas in their lungs. Hypoxemia and large alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure differences [P(A-a)O2] were due to inhomogeneity of alveolar ventilation. Results indicated that up to ten days to two weeks, bronchoscopic bronchial washing may in some instances improve maximal expiratory flow-volume curves and specific airway conductance and decrease P(A-a)O2 towards normal.

This suggests that there is a different cause for the allergy in the two groups, perhaps because the asthmatics have a transient period of susceptibility to sensitization in infancy and the CF children a persistent vulnerability. Amongst the asthmatic children, clinical improvement was associated with loss of some skin prick test reactions, and clinical deterioration with an increase in the number of positive reactions. Thus continuing allergic reactions may maintain a mucosal defect, resulting in a persistence of susceptibility to allergen sensitization, and control of the reactions may re-establish normal mucosal defence mechanisms.',\n",

Duplication of the pancreatic ducts is a rare entity, probably arising from accidental misplacement of mucosal cells from the duodenum or stomach during the development of the pancreatic pouches.  Congenital pancreatic cysts may be single, multiple, unilocular or multilocular and can be associated with polycystic disease of the kidney, liver or spleen.  Ectopic pancreas occurs before or during the rotation of the ventral pancreas and its fusion with the dorsal pancreas.  Few tumours of the pancreas have been reported in children less than 15 years of age.  The evaluation of patients via different pancreatic function tests is significant only when the results are interpreted in the light of clinical manifestations.  Tests of exocrine pancreatic function in childhood include stool examination, the triolein test, blood examination, analysis of duodenal contents, the secretin-pancreozymin test, pancreatic scanning with selenomethionine, transduodenal pancreatogram, abdominal ultrasound and arteriography, and upper gastrointestinal x-ray.

The typical shortcomings of an assay measuring biological activity have been studied, and the means to overcome the weaknesses of the oyster gill cilia assay have been established. The presence of the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor (CFMI) in experimental fractions may be determined by accepting data from only those assays in which authentic CF and normal (non-CF) fractions give defined reactions, by measuring the reaction of each sample at least three times, and by examining each experimental sample at a protein concentration greater than the minimum established in this study. The relative concentrations of the CFMI present in the first steps of purification of serum and medium have been calculated in terms of units of inhibition. Generally, the units of inhibition present in serum and medium fractions from heterozygotes are close to one-half of that in fractions from homozygous sources. Analogous fractions concentrated from a normal (non-CF) source never inhibited mucociliary activity, even when tested at nearly 100 times the CF concentration.

Our findings not only bear relevance to the intestinal manifestations of CF and to the increased incidence of cholelithiasis but perhaps also to the early deposition within the intrahepatic ducts of eosinophilic mucus concretions proposed as the cause of biliary cirrhosis in this disease.',\n",

In a child or young adult with known or suspected cystic fibrosis, the triad of recurrent colicky abdominal pain, a mass in the right lower quadrant, and mechanical intestinal obstruction provides a clue to diagnosis of meconium ileus equivalent.

PANCREATIN: tu.Bile acid kinetics was investigated by stable isotope dilution technique in 6 children (ages 3 1/2 months to 4 1/2 years) with previously untreated cystic fibrosis.  All of the patients had clinical and laboratory evidence of malabsorption, normal intestinal mucosal function, as judged by glucose absorption, intestinal histology, disaccharidase levels, and normally functioning gallbladders.  The children were maintained on a constant diet throughout the study period; fat intake averaged 4.2 g per kg per day.  Before administration of pancreatic enzyme replacement, fat excretion equalled 50 plus or minus 4% (mean plus or minus SE) of intake and was reduced to 20 plus or minus 1.0% of intake after therapy.  Total bile acid pool size nearly doubled during enzyme replacement from 379 plus or minus 32 micromoles per kg to 620 plus or minus 36 micromoles per kg with secondary bile acids comprising 57% of the total pool before therapy and 40% after therapy.  Total bile acid synthesis changed little with therapy, equalling 139 plus or minus 17 micromoles per kg per day (total 602 plus or minus 109 mg per day) without enzyme replacement and 125 plus or minus 19 micromoles per kg per day (total 470 plus or minus 86 milligrams per day) with enzyme replacement.  This was confirmed by the fecal excretion of bile acids: 545 plus or minus 166 milligrams of bile acid per day were excreted without enzymes as compared to 513 plus or minus 146 milligrams per day with enzymes. After therapy, the fractional turnover rate of the bile acid pool was reduced from 0.602 plus or minus 0.05 per day to 0.233 plus or minus .03 per day for cholic acidand from 0.696 plus or minus 0.09 per day to 0.39 plus or minus 0.04 per day for chenodeoxycholic acid.  These data indicate that both primary and secondary bile acids are conserved within the enterohepatic circulation during enzyme therapy, and that the mechanism for the regulation of hepatic bile acid synthesis is intact in cystic fibrosis.  However, the demonstration that large amounts of bile acid continue to be excreted during therapy suggests that interruption of the enterohepatic circulation continues and that deficiencies of the intraluminal phase may persist during enzyme therapy in this disease.',\n",

The patients were divided into five groups according to the symptoms present at the time of diagnosis and survival rates were recorded separately for each group. Survival was less good in the group of patients presenting initially with pulmonary symptoms compared to the group presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. In the group presenting with meconium ileus survival was poor initially, but later in the course of the disease it became similar to that observed in the other groups. The differences in survival between the different categories occurred during the first two years after diagnosis. The study shows that, on clinical grounds, a severe form of the disease which is characterized by early manifestation of pulmonary symptoms and poor survival can be distinguished from a more protracted form with a better survival. Because of the great inter-individual variability large numbers of patients will have to be evaluated in order to achieve statistically significant results in studies which attempt to compare different therapeutic approaches. If such numbers cannot be reached, it may be necessary to compare only patients who belong to the same symptomatic category.',\n",

However, higher reproductive fitness by heterozygotes (expressed by t greater than 0) or higher gametic viability of the cf allele (expressed by a greater than 0.5) can provide reasonable explanations of the present frequency. Furthermore, birth replacement in families with CF children (RPE) can account for the estimated historical values of t. Today, however, t is probably at or approaching zero as a result of discontinuation of RPE. In the future we can look for an imperceptibly slow decrease in the incidence of CF.

Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of chronic hypoxemia. There was a high correlation between the weight of individual carotid bodies in each case. Among the 12 patients with chronic hypoxemia, eight patients had carotid bodies heavier than predicted by statistical analysis. Of these eight patients, six had cystic fibrosis and two had cyanotic heart disease. Morphometric and cell population analyses of the carotid bodies from these eight patients and from those of the control population indicated that enlargement of the carotid bodies during normal or abnormal growth results from proportionate increases in lobule parenchyma and stroma. There was also an increase in the width and length of the lobules without an increase in the diameter of the cell cords or a change in the size or proportion of the chief cells. Growth and development of the carotid bodies were studied in a control group of 59 patients without chronic hypoxemia. There were no sex related differences in carotid body weights. The combined weight of the carotid bodies correlated most strongly with body weight, although there was some correlation with age and body length.

Assays of these enzymes under the same conditions in extracts of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, and pig tracheal mucosa indicated that these extracellular airway enzymes were probably not derived from these cell types.  Although the above three enzymes were present in secretions of all patients with these three diseases, large amounts of palmitoyl lysolecithin, free fatty acids, and dipalmitoyl lecithin were found only in patients having alveolar proteinosis and asthma.  The amount of free fatty acids in these secretions was sufficient to inhibit both the lysolecithinase and the lysolecithin-lysolecithin acyltransferase, but not the phospholipase A2.  These findings suggest that the large amount of dipalmitoyl lecithin, free fatty acids, and lysolecithin found in these secretions results from extracellular remodelling by these enzymes.

The patient group had a lowered incidence of plaque and less gingival disease than did the control group in which every person had some amount of plaque or gingival disease.

The reasons for the finding of minimal plaque in the patient group could be related to several factors, including the life-long use of various antibiotic agents, the chewing of digestive enzyme supplements, the effect of medical management on tooth hardness, and the effect of stained teeth (possible tetracycline deposition) on the plaque microorganisms. It appears that the therapy for cystic fibrosis was beneficial to the periodontal health of these patients. Much further study is needed to understand the interrelationship between an altered oral environment (salivary changes in cystic fibrosis), altered microbial flora (by antibiotics, enzymes) and even altered tooth surfaces (possible tetracycline deposition). Most patients were found to have one or more oral habits. Tooth mobility was associated with tension habits.

VITAMIN-E-DEFICIENCY: co.The role of vitamin E in human nutrition was studied by investigation of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and associated pancreatic insufficiency.  Vitamin E status was assessed by measurement of the plasma concentration of the principal circulating isomer, alpha-tocopherol.  Results of such determinations in 52 CF patients with pancreatogenic steatorrhea revealed that all were deficient in the vitamin.  The extent of decreased plasma tocopherol varied markedly but correlated with indices of intestinal malabsorption, such as the serum carotene concentration and percentage of dietary fat absorbed.  Supplementation with 5-10 times the recommended daily allowance of vitamin E in a water-miscible form increased the plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations to normal in all 19 CF patients so evaluated. Studies on the effects of vitamin E deficiency focused on possible hematologic alterations.  An improved technique was developed to measure erythrocyte hemolysis in vitro in the presence of hydrogen peroxide.  While erythrocyte suspensions from control subjects demonstrated resistance to hemolysis during a 3-h incubation, all samples from tocopherol-deficient CF patients showed abnormal oxidant susceptibility, evidenced by greater than 5% hemoglobin release.  The degree of peroxide-induced hemolysis was related to the plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrationin an inverse, sigmoidal manner.  The possibility of in vivo hemolysis was assessed by measuring the survival of 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes in 19 vitamin-E deficient patients.  A moderate but statistically significant decrease in the mean 51Cr erythrocyte half-life value was found in this group.  Measurement of erythrocyte survival before and after supplementation of 6 patients with vitamin E demonstrated that the shortened erythrocyte lifespan could be corrected to normal with this treatment.  Other hematologic indices in deficient subjects, however, were normal and did not change upon supplementation with vitamin E.  It is concluded that CF is invariably associated with vitamin E deficiency, provided that the patient in question has pancreatic achylia and is not taking supplementary doses of tocopherol.  Concomitant hematologic effects consistent with mild hemolysis, but not anemia, occur and may be reversed with vitamin E therapy.

URIC-ACID: ur.The relationship between the dosage of pancreatic extract and the excretion of uric acid was investigated in 29 patients with cystic fibrosis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Urinary excretion of uric acid was normal in patients receiving small doses of pancreatic extracts and abnormally high in those receiving large amounts. In the latter group, normouricosuria was achieved by reducing the dose of pancreatic extract. Normal stool patterns and adequate weight gains were preserved by a diet modification that was well accepted by the patients. To eliminate the potential renal consequences of hyperuricosuria, it seems appropriate to control the need for increasing amounts of pancreatic enzymes by limiting the dietary intake of fat and maintaining a positive caloric and nitrogen balance with high intake of protein and carbohydrates and supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides.',\n",

CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: im.The possibility has been raised that complement plays a role in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  This impairment would be consistent with the thesis that the alternative pathway had been activated in vivo and, therefore, depleted.  The purpose of this work is to explore further the function of the alternative pathway in cystic fibrosis.  Examination of the data using Student's t test and analysis of variance showed no significant difference in the mean hemolytic activity of sera of CF patients as compared to the control group.  The data presented do not support the work of Polley and Bearn who demonstrated an abnormality in CF patients using conversion of C3 by inulin as assay.  The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.  Our results do not preclude in vivo activation of the alternative pathway, since a compensatory increase in synthesis of components could offset component consumption.  Since the net result is a completely normal level of activity, however, it does not seem likely that significant consumption has occurred.\",\n",

They correctly worry about long-term ill effects of such therapy.  In treated CF patients the uricosuria results primarily from the increased dietary purine load, though the abnormal transport physiology in CF may contribute.  Even though final evidence on risk is not at hand, prudence would suggest holding the purine load in CF patients to the minimum needed to ensure digestion of sufficient foodstuffs without necessarily permitting a \"normal\" diet sans steatorrhea.

PNEUMOTHORAX: th.Cystic fibrosis is the most common form of chronic pulmonary disease in the pediatric age group.  As these children survive longer with improved therapy, the incidence of pneumothorax has increased.  In our patients who were more than 10 years of age, the incidence of pneumothorax was 12.5 percent.  We have reviewed the records of 22 patients who have had 44 episodes of pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis.  In addition, our experience includes one child with histiocytosis in whom pneumothorax was a serious complication. One other pneumothorax occurred in a teen-age girl with apical bullous disease.  A child who presents with even a minimal pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis is at considerable risk of developing an increasing lung collapse.  Even if the pneumothorax resolves, there is a high risk of recurrence.  In children treated with only a chest tube there was a 50 percent recurrence. Consequently, we recommend a chest tube for any episode of pneumothorax in a child with cystic fibrosis, with installation of a sclerosing agent when the lung expands.  Three of our patients so treated had no recurrence.  Children who have a persistent air leak are confined to bed, retain secretions, and pursue a rapid downhill course.  A more aggressive approach to these children, consisting of thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, pteural symphysis, and pulmonary lavage is feasible and the mortality rate is low.  A pneumothorax in a child with no evidence of cystic fibrosis is a rare event.  A persistent air leak is an indication for thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, and lung biopsy.  Histiocytosis X is one rare cause for this complication in children.',\n",

Human rectal goblet and columnar cells transported 3H- glucosamine-labeled secretory products at a substantially slower rate than do comparable colonic cells in smaller mammals.

The absence of C.F. may stem from their limited numbers (7000) but I suggest that it may have at least partially a genetic basis.  Homozygotes with C.F. are subject to salt-losing crises which can be fatal in hot weather and heterozygotes often have an increased concentration of sodium and chlorine ions in their sweat.  The influence of environmental temperature and drought may explain why C.F. occurs among Blacks in temperate zones of the United States but not in Africa, and is less frequent in the hot southern regions of Europe than in the colder, more northern areas.  Negative selection of this type may have operated only in hot, arid environments and the possibility that other environments offered advantages to C.F. heterozygotes cannot be excluded.',\n",

To evaluate the specificity of the ciliary dyskinesia activity (CDA) detected, we bioassayed serum from eight patients with bronchial asthma.  We found that all eight asthmatic sera caused a ciliary dyskinesia reaction; however, sera from asthmatics generally caused a subsequent ciliostasis (cessation of ciliary beating).  Concurrent evaluation of all sera for CDA by bioassay and for cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) by electrofocusing showed that all CDA-positive sera except seven of the eight asthmatic sera were also positive for CFP (our specific marker for the CF gene).  These two finding indicated that the activity detected in patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases could be a substance different from a CF-specific CDF.  To test our hypothesis, we set out to purify the CDAs in asthmatic, CF homozygote and OHCF sera.  Representative results clearly indicate that the asthmatic CDA is found in DEAE-II and Sephadex G-200 Fraction II, whereas the CDA found in CF and OHCF sera elutes in DEAE-I and Sephadex G-200 Fractions III and IV (weak CDA).  We conclude that the CDAs in asthma and CF are distinct substances.  Our findings may facilitate purification of what we feel is a CF-specific CDF from CF and OHCF serum.

In all cases, the addition of pancreatic supplement to the general diet improved protein digestibility and utilisation.  Substituting 85% of the dietary protein with the enzymic casein hydrolysate resulted in further improvement in nitrogen balance (but not digestibility) for five of the patients. Urinary nitrogen levels of the casein hydrolysate diet tended to be lower, which accounts for the finding above.  With the acid-hydrolysed protein, urinary nitrogen was higher when compared with the excretion from the partial casein hydrolysate and provided smaller positive nitrogen balances.  These preliminary findings indicate that, for some patients with pancreatic insufficiency, partial hydrolysates have greater potential for nitrogen retention than the administration of exogenous pancreatic extracts with intact protein.

Correlation between cystic fibrosis protein and ciliary dyskinesia activity in serum shown by a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay.BLOOD-PROTEINS: an.  CYSTIC-FIBROSIS: bl.  ISOELECTRIC-FOCUSING.We have developed a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay for use in investigating a possible correlation between cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF) in human serum. The bioassay requires high standards of tissue selection, and all epithelial tissue must be free of underlying connective tissue. When serum samples were collected and processed carefully and warmed to 37 degrees before assay, CDF could be reliably detected in 31 of 31 sera from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes in 35 min or less without prior fractionation or concentration of sera, whereas 13 of 14 normal control sera were nonreactive. CDF-positive serum reacts in three consecutive phases: (1) initial increase in ciliary beat frequency, (2) ciliary dyskinesia, and (3) tissue destruction with extrusion of single ciliated cells, mucus, and debris. Our results confirm the association of CDF with cystic fibrosis. The bioassay is not specific for CF, however, when whole sera are bioassayed, since serum from several patients with bronchial asthma also caused ciliary dyskinesia. However, this finding need not preclude using rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelial tissue as an assay for following the purification of CDF. Isoelectric focusing showed that the presence or absence of CFP corresponded with that of dyskinesia activity in all sera tested except for the active samples from seven asthma patients, which were negative for CFP. The results indicate that CFP and CDF may be identical or closely related markers for the CF gene, and suggest that the activity detected by the rabbit tracheal bioassay in sera from patients with asthma and other diseases probably is caused by a substance different from a CF- specific CDF.',\n",

The possibility that the effects of the two drugs may be additive was investigated by assessing their combined effects on glandular and salivary C++ and protein in the rat submaxillary gland. Individually, their effects were also assessed in relation to the dose used. Results indicate that: (1) treatment for 7 days with 0.05, 0.50, and 5.0 mg/kg daily dose of reserpine caused, respectively, a 45%, 95%, and 120% increase in glandular Ca++ and a 9.3%, 16.5%, and 37.4% increase in glandular protein; (2) treatment for 7 days with a 5.0 mg/kg daily dose of isoproterenol caused a 138% increase in gland Ca++ and a 12.38% increase in gland protein. Treatment with a 5.0 mg/rat daily dose of this drug caused increases of 166% and 10.3% in gland Ca++ and protein; (3) in experiments involving a combination of the two drugs, isoproterenol was administered in a 5.0 mg/kg daily dose from days 1-7 and reserpine in a 0.5 mg/kg daily dose from days 4-10 of the treatment schedule. This procedure resulted in (a) a 217% increase in gland Ca++ and a 25.7% increase in gland protein; (b) a marked accumulation of a granular, basophilic material in acinar cells and the development of intraductal precipitates; (c) the secretion of turbid saliva with high Ca++ and protein concentrations after a secretory dose of isoproterenol (this type of stimulation also reduced the gland Ca++ (50%) and protein (20%) contents and produced vacuolization in the acinar cells); (d) the secretion of saliva with elevated Ca++ and protein in response to pilocarpine (these elevated concentrations were, however, one-fifth of those obtained after isoproterenol stimulation); (e) the secretion of smaller volume of saliva after both types of stimulation.

The animals mentioned above were exposed to a finely divided aerosol suspension of a coagulase-positive strain of S. aureus in phosphate buffer.  Immediately after the exposure, half of the animals were killed, and the remaining half were killed 4 hr later.  In each experimental unit the mice killed immediately after the exposure were as similar as possible to the mice killed 4 hr later with respect to genotype, age, and sex; some were siblings. The uncleared bacteria (UBR) in 4 hr were 0.20 for the mice without any CF-like alterations (BALB/c) and the C57BL/6J-bg, bg/bg genotypes; 0.28 for C57BL/6J-bg, +/? genotypes; 0.50 for the DBA/2J-cri, +/? genotypes; and 0.56 for cri/cri mice.

The method of isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) specified by Wilson et al.

A small molecular substance of less than 10,000 but greater than 1,000 daltons (by Amicon filtration) was found associated with gamma-globulin fractions isolated from sera of these same cystic patients and their parents. Once separated by PM-10 ultrafiltration, this small substance was unable to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in eight of eight CF and five of five CF carrier individuals unless pooled purified human IgG was added. In addition, the IgG-rich fraction retained by PM-10 ultrafiltration was still able to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in the bioassay, an event noted in our earlier work with whole serum. The size of the small serum substance and its association with IgG closely corresponds to that described for the oyster test system, as well as to that produced by cultured cells derived from homozygotes and heteroxygotes for this genetic disorder. The persistence of the ability to promote mucociliary disturbances by the IgG-rich retentate PM-10 fractions may be indicative of the ineffective molecular separation by the Amicon ultransfiltration apparatus or may represent another CF-related, IgG-associated substance not influenced by ultrafiltration. Speculation The genetic disturbance of CF can be explained by the presence of a molecule(s) which has an affinity for IgG, which in turn gives rise to the various physiologic facets of this disorder.

Concurrently, the CDA's in sera from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or bronchial asthma were shown to be different substances by ion- exchange or gel permeation chromatographic procedures. Sephadex G-200 chromatography indicated that the CF-CDA eluted with a protein fraction of molecular weight (MW) 68,000-150,000 and that the asthma CDA was found in a protein fraction of MV greater than 150,000. The two activities could also be separated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Prior acidification of whole normal, CF homozygote, obligate heterozygote, or asthmatic sera to pH 3.7 using EDTA, followed by fractionation of Sephadex G-200 removed all the CDA's from fractions of highermolecular  weight and shifted the activities to a protein fraction of MW 1,100-13,700. This procedure afforded a 200-fold purification of the CDA's in sera from patients with asthma or CF. EDTA treatment, however, also generated a CDA in previously nonreactive normal sera. Subsequent fractionation of the various active G-200 fractions on Bio-Gel P10 allowed for the separation of three separate activities (Bio-Gel Fractions I, II-IV, and V). Fraction I was shown to represent the activity in sera from patients with asthma and was determined to be C3a (MW 9,000). Fraction I was also found in normal, CF, and carrier sera and therefore is not a specific CDA. Fraction II-IV is thought to represent a CF-specific CDA (MW 5,000) since it could not be demonstrated in either normal or asthmatic sera but was found in sera of obligate heterozygotes. Fraction III-IV also did not react with antisera to human C3a. Fraction V was generated from all serum types upon acidification of the serum with EDTA and is thought to be a nonspecific CDA. Bio-Gel P10 filtration of Sephadex G-200 fractions provided 823-fold and 650- fold purification of the asthmatic and CF CDA's, respectively. Concurrent analysis of column fractions for CDA's by bioassay and for CFP by electrofocusing showed CFP only in fractions that contained the CF-CDA. Combined analyses employing acid disc gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and EDTA treatment of active CF-immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Sephadex G-200 column fractions, followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography, provided evidence that CFP was associated with the CF-CDA.

OUABAIN: pd.We demonstrate previously that fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are significantly more resistant to the toxic effects of ouabain than normal human fibroblasts are. Ouabain is generally assumed to act primarily at the level of the cell membrane and to cause killing of cells by inhibiting ion transport. We have therefore examined the ability of normal and CF cells to survive exposure to ethacrynic acid, another inhibitor of ion transport, and to survive colchicine and aminopterin, resistance to which has been associated with membrane alterations in other cells. The effect of dexamethasone, which has a sterol nucleus similar to that of ouabain but is thought to have a different site of cellular action, was also tested. Exposure of the cells to ethacrynic acid, colchicine, or aminopterin did not reveal any differences in survival between normal and CF fibroblasts. However, CF cells survived exposure to dexamethasone significantly better than normal cells did. These results suggest that normal and CF cells do not differ in terms of a generalized resistance to ion transport inhibitors or to drugs that must pass through the membrane to be active. Instead, the results raise the possibility that CF cells have an enhanced resistance to drugs that have the sterol nucleus found in ouabain and dexamethasone.',\n",

The name is a shortening of the old term Cystic Fibrosis (or Fibrocystic disease) of the pancreas.  This comes from the historical appearance at post-mortem first described by Landsteiner in 1905.  It was only in 1938 that Dorothee Anderson and Fanconi realised that the disease was a separate entity and not simply a manifestation of other illnesses.  Another name is Mucoviscidosis which gives a clue as to one of the most important features of the disease.  Mucus formed is thicker and stickier (more viscid) than normal and tends to clog up the bronchi and ducts, particularly the pancreatic ducts.  Chronic bronchitis with recurrent severe infection and malabsorption are the main symptoms of the disease. The other important abnormality is an increased amount of sodium chloride (salt) in the sweat.  This fact, used in the diagnosis, was first realised during a heat wave in New York in 1953 when it was noticed that most of the children with heat prostration suffered from C.F.  Little is known of the causes of the abnormalities of sweat and mucus.  Some generalised cell abnormality (? enzymatic) seems possible.

Poor prognosis in cystic fibrosis was associated with chronic colonization (9 months - more than 5 years) of the respiratory tract with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and with an onset of the chronic colonization before puberty. Among the patients with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, poor prognosis was associated with high numbers of precipitins against antigens from these bacteria (up to 61).

The original method of sweat chloride analysis proposed by the Orion Research Corporation (Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139) is inadequate because it produces erratic and misleading results. The modified method was compared with the reference quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke. In the modified method, individual electrode pads are cut and placed in the electrodes rather than using the pads supplied by the company; pilocarpine nitrate (2,000 mg/l) is used in place of pilocarpine HCl (640 mg/l); sodium bicarbonate as the weak electrolyte is used instead of K2SO4. A 10-minute period for sweat accumulation is employed rather than a zero-time collection as in the original Orion method. The modification has been studied for reproducibility in individuals, reproducibility between right and left arm in individuals; it has been compared extensively with the quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke, both in normal individuals and in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Our observation of MPS in a patient with exocrine pancreatic deficiency suggests that the MPS observed in the CF patients reported by Rosenstein is probably caused by pancreatic deficiency.  The frequent occurrence of meconium ileus (MI) in CF and the rarity of MPS in CF is curious, since they may be different manifestations of the same pathologic process. Conceivably, MPS may occur with total absence of pancreatic enzymes (as in our patient and in a few patients with CF).  Low levels of enzymes in CF may limit expression to meconium ileus.  We wish to suggest the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic function in these patients even if CF has been excluded by sweat tests. - There is conflicting, albeit fragmentary, data suggesting that exocrine pancreatic deficiency may not be the sole cause of meconium obstruction in CF.  Several investigators have suggested that MI may be the result of abnormal protein and mucoprotein secretions by the intestinal goblet cells and not from lack of pancreatic enzymes alone.  While these observations suggest that exocrine pancreatic deficiency may not play a major role in all instance of meconium obstruction, it is important to note that there may be little correlation between the histologic appearance of the pancreas and exocrine function.',\n",

STANOLONE: pd.Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from individuals with the autosomal recessive disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), were shown previously to be significantly  more resistant to the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid hormone, than were normal human fibroblasts. Here cystic fibrosis fibroblasts are also shown to be more resistant than normal human fibroblasts to the cytotoxic effects of the sex hormones, 17 beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone and progesterone. Since cells are believed to contain different receptors for each of the steroid hormones, it is not probable than the resistance of CF cells to these hormones results from a receptor deficiency. This was shown by the fact that CF cells were found to exhibit the same receptor activity as normal cells for 3-H-dexamethasone. Furthermore, neither normal human nor CF fibroblasts could be demonstrated to contain detectable receptor activity for 3H-17 beta-estradiol. In addition, the studies of fibroblast killing by hormones led to the further interesting observation that normal human diploid fibroblasts, regardless of the sex of the tissue donor, are sensitive to killing by each of the sex hormones. These findings suggest that the cytotoxic effects of the steroid hormones may be observed independently of the specific hormone receptors. The studies reported here thus suggest that the resistance of CF cells to the different steroid hormones is probably the result of a defect in a pathway in cellular steroid hormone metabolism other than that involving receptors.',\n",

These sputum precipitins were directed principally against food, fungi, bacteria, and human body tissue.  On the other hand, precipitins to Staphylococcus alpha-hemolysin was the main type of immunoprecipitin detected in CF serum and was found in 60% of the serum specimens examined.  It seems likely that the precipitins in patients with CF may be involved in the formation of immune complexes which, in conjunction with complement, may be responsible for the respiratory and gastrointestinal lesions that are common in patients with CF. The immune complexes may be the result of excess food and bacterial antigens escaping across the gut and lungs as a result of some abnormality of the SIgA system.  Over 80% of the sputum specimens tested gave positive precipitins in agar gel against human seminal fluid and colostrum, suggesting that some of the antibodies formed in CF patients could be directed against host tissue, and may account for an autoimmune-type reaction in CF.  Crossreaction between the high-titer antibody to Staphylococcus and basement membrane of lungs and pancreas, with complement activation, may occur in CF and required further study.  The high number of B-cells, as detected by antibody, coated complement, activated sheep erythrocytes, and EAC rosettes, may be partly responsible for the synthesis of the variety of antibodies detected in CF patients.',\n",

They are of great interest to biochemists and geneticists, as well as to paediatricians and internist for whom they often present special diagnostic and therapeutic problems.  The study of the inborn errors of metabolism also has implications in the fields of epidemiology and social medicine.  The number of known inborn errors of metabolism has increased rapidly in recent years, and others, as yet unidentified, presumably await recognition.  Only a few of these conditions can be treated now, but the realisation that early diagnosis is essential in order to achieve good results has stimulated interest in the possibility of examining either whole populations or selected predisposed groups of individuals for biochemical differences which characterise particular inherited metabolic diseases.  This article reviews some recent developments with particular reference to the indications for such screening programmes and progress in the identification of previously unknown inborn errors of metabolism in otherwise homogeneous population groups.  The inborn errors of metabolism are due to single gene mutations.  Recognition of the asymptomatic individuals who are heterozygous for the abnormal gene causing the disease may be important clinically and the identification has to be considered as one aspect of metabolic screening for the inborn errors of metabolism.',\n",

In this study, quantitative stereological methods were applied to biopsies of rectal mucosa from 5 CF patients, 5 sibling controls, and 2 normal adults, to measure goblet cell numbers, crypt luminal volume, and volume of intracellular mucus. It was found that CF crypt lumina were variably dilated, but that the average relative volume of intracellular mucus and the numbers of goblet cells in CF mucosae were comparable to those of sibling and adult controls. In CF biopsies, however, surface columnar absorptive cells consistently contained putative lipid droplets and rapidly accumulated additional large lipid droplets during short term organ culture.

PROTEIN-BINDING.A method for estimating a 'heparin binding capacity' of human serum is described. When human serum is diluted with a low ionic strength, heparin-containing buffer at pH 5.5, protein-heparin electrostatic complexes form in solution with subsequent formation of insoluble aggregates which can be collected by centrifugation. Quantitative determination of the relative amounts by weight of protein and heparin in the insoluble heparin-protein aggregates permits estimation of a combining ratio at which serum proteins bind with heparin to precipitate from solution. This weight combining ratio of protein and heparin is a quantitative measure of the total affinity for heparin of all proteins in serum which bind heparin at pH 5.57 to form an insoluble complex. An unusually high affinity for heparin by an abnormal serum protein or an increase in amount of a normally- occuring, high heparin-affinity, serum protein would alter the average protein: heparin combining ratio and increase the 'heparin- binding capacity' of human serum. The converse would be true for serum proteins having a low affinity for heparin, lowering the 'heparin-binding capacity' of human serum.

The fact that there may be mutations affecting distinct enzymes could account for the genetic heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis.  A consequence of a defective kallikrein system would be accumulation of a precursor related to the low molecular weight kininogen and we propose that this compound is the ciliary-dyskinesia factor.',\n",

LEUKOCYTES: se.Cell-free culture medium from PHA-stimulated PBL cultures or long-term lymphoid cell lines from CF homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes, as well as serum from such individuals, can produce three distinct changes in the ciliary beat of rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelium: (1) increased beat frequency, (2) CD, and (3) ciliostasis.  The ability to produce both 1 and 2 seems to be characteristic for leukocyte cultures from CF genotypes: 46 of 49 CF cultures produced both effects, as compared with none of 16 cultures from normal controls and 1 of 10 from non-CF patient controls with bronchial asthma.  CTA was not specific for CF PBL cultures, since 13% of normal control and 60% of the non-CF patient control cultures produced ciliostasis.  Similar findings were obtained when serum from the same individuals or culture medium from long-term lymphoid cell lines was tested.  Using protein A from Staphylococcus aureus covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B as a reagent, we separated the CDAs present in serum and in culture medium from PBL and lymphoid cultures.  Protein A specifically adsorbs IgG and binds it under mild conditions at physiological pH.  The CDAs are noncovalently bound to IgG at physiological pH and can be co-purified with IgG.  The IgG-CDA complexes can be readily desorbed from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at pH 3.0, and under these conditions the CDAs are dissociated from IgG, retain all their activity, and can be separated by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-10 or Sephadex G-200.  Three distinct activities were removed from serum or PBL cultures which showed both CDA and CTA, and two were obtained from samples which showed only CDA.  One CDA believed to be specific for CF (CF-CDA) was separated from CF serum and PBL or lymphoid cell culture medium.  This CF-CDA was complexed noncovalently to IgG (not subclass IgG3), had a molecular weight of 4000 to 6000, was stable as acid pH, was found in biological fluids from both homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, was shown not to be C3a (anaphylatoxin), did not require IgG for activity, and was positively charged at pH values more acidic than 8.0.',\n",

In CF infants over 6 mth of age, but not in controls, there was an increase along the gut from duodenum to ileum of both weakly acidic and strongly acidic sulphomucins. In the ileum the increase was in total mucins from 6 mth previously in the same CF patients and this difference could be accounted for by an increase of sialidase-resistant mucins. The increase in sulphomucins was more marked at the tip than at the base of the villi. In CF neonates there was significant difference in the quantities of acidic mucins. The question whether the mucins of CF are chemically abnormal or merely accumulated to an abnormal extent is probably best investigated by analysis of sialidase-resistant mucins and sulphomucins of the ileum and strongly acidic sulphomucins of the duodenum and jejunum in CF infants over 6 mth of age.',\n",

The results accord with the original hypothesis of Burns and May.  In 13 of 20 patients the sputum bacterial flora changed as the hypothesis of Burns and May predicted.  This preliminary data suggests that one of the primary sputum abnormalities in cystic fibrosis may be increased Ca++ which makes the sputum susceptible to colonisation by S. aureus.

It is somewhat surprising that the authors suggest that a suitable inhaled or ingested lectin may be useful in treating patients with cystic fibrosis, since the very symptoms produced by the ingested lectin resemble those associated with the disease.  A more attractive recommendation would be for patients with cystic fibrosis to avoid substances containing lectins such as Con A to avoid stimulating additional mucus release.  The underlying pathogenetic defect in cystic fibrosis may be inappropriate, excessive stimuli by lectin-like substances.  These observations suggest that the increase in the protein content of lymphocytes is stimulated by a plasma factor present in patients with cystic fibrosis and in carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene.  These observations, plus those of Freed and Buckley, might suggest that cystic fibrosis is a disease involving a plasma factor with lectin or Con A-like activity which stimulates the secretion of mucus and increases the enzyme content of circulating or cultured lymphocytes. - Professor Lieberman confuses cause with effect.  If there is excessive mucus production in cystic fibrosis we suggest that this is because the secretion is so difficult to remove from the mucosal surface.

RESERPINE: pd.The chronically reserpinized rat has been proposed as an animal model for cystic fibrosis on the basis of morphologic and secretory alterations in the submaxillary gland and of abnormalities in pulmonary secretions.  In this investigation, the volume and composition of pancreatic juice from reserpine treated rats (0.5 mg/kg/day) have been compared to those of untreated controls after stimulation with purified cholecystokinin (0.1 microgram/kg body weight) and with crude and purified preparations of secretin (6 microns/100 g body weight) infused iv for 30-min periods.  The results demonstrate that the treated animals secreted a significantly lower volume of pancreatic juice after stimulation with these secretagogues.  Flow rates were also significantly reduced after stimulation with cholecystokinin and crude secretin. Protein and amylase outputs in response to cholecystokinin were smaller than in control animals after unrestritced feedings, but greater after a 24-hr fast.  Total bicarbonate output was also reduced after stimulation with either crude or purified secretin and the normal excretion patterns for bicarbonate and chloride were either absent of reversed in the secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice of the treated animals.  Whole pancreas homogenates from the treated animals showed significant increases in Ca++ and protein content.  These results indicate that chronic administration of reserpine alters the secretion of water, protein, and bicarbonate from the rat pancreas and that it affects several of the exocrine glands involved in cystic fibrosis.  These findings lend support to the concept of an animal model for the human disease.  The chronic administration of reserpine to rats has been shown to induce alterations in salivary and pulmonary secretions which resemble those seen in patients with cystic fibrosis.  The concept of an animal model has been proposed on the basis of these observations. The pancreas is another exocrine gland prominently involved in cystic fibrosis and if it can be demonstrated that reserpine administration also induces alterations in pancreatic secretion, the concept of the animal model would be strengthened considerably.',\n",

CF heterozygotes had mean stimulation ratio and mean net isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP intermediate betweem normal and CF.  There were no statistically significant differences among normal subjects, CF patients, and CF heterozygotes in basal cAMP or prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP.  Purified mononuclear cells from five normal persons and seven CF homozygotes had the same basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP, but isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was markedly depressed (P < 0.01) in the CF cells.  Granulocytes from six normal persons and nine CF patients also had the same basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP, but isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was decreased (P < 0.05) in the CF samples.  These results clearly demonstrate a difference between normal and CF leukocytes in cAMP response to beta-adrenergic stimulation.  The diminised cAMP response to beta-adrenergic stimulation in CF is probably related to the presence of a CF gene, and may interact with other genetic abnormalities to produce the clinical syndrome of CF.\",\n",

This article reports the immediate effects of Intralipid infusion in patients with CF in an attempt to ascertain through biochemical data whether the use of Intralipid at the reported dose is free of untoward effects.  Six patients with CF were placed in a protocol that called for periodic infusions with soybean oil emulsion containing EFAs.  The first three patients received 2 gm/kg of body weight of Intralipid over a four-hour period.  The other three patients received half that dose over the same period.

The progression in airway obstruction was measured by change in serial measurements of maximal midexpiratory flow (MMEF), from which a regression equation of MMEF against time was obtained for each individual. Changes in MMEF value with or without therapy were compared in patients matched for severity of disease as indicated by initial MMEF values. For the group as a whole no differences were found in the progression of the airway obstruction whether the patients received mist tent therapy or not. This therapy failed to benefit any of the groups of children with CF who had early, moderate, or advanced airway obstruction as judged from their initial MMEF value.

We studied 50 patients with CF and compared their responsiveness to inhaled histamine with that of asthmatic children. The incidence of positive responses to inhaled histamine was 24% in the patients with CF and more than 90% in the asthmatic patients. We found no correlation, in the patients with CF, between the histamine response and several indexes of atopy (clinical allergic disease and positive allergen skin tests). Positive responders to histamine were not evenly distributed over the disease spectrum of CF. Instead, positive responses occurred only in those patients whose prechallenge pulmonary function was abnormal.

The results were compared with those of patients with congenitally immotile cilia (immotile-cilia syndrome). Mucociliary clearance could be demonstrated in all the seven CF patients who succeeded in inhaling the test aerosol. Ciliary ultrastructure from a deceased CF patient was normal. Patients with the immotile cilia syndrome had no substantial clearance and defective cilia. The CF patients coughed more during the clearance measurements than any other group studied earlier, and their coughing was effective. One patient succeeded in avoiding coughing in both measurements and had faster clearance when he got terbutaline than when he got the vehicle. Although younger, the CF patients tended to be more obstructed in their lungs and more handicapped than the patients suffering from the immotile-cilia syndrome. The latter patients had more discomfort from rhinitis, sinusitis and otitis than had the CF patients.

We now show that CF fibroblasts also exhibit greatly increased resistance to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP), as well as to isoproterenol and theophylline, drugs which are known to increase endogenous levels of cAMP. CF cells were also shown to have normal amounts of (3H)cAMP binding to protein kinase as well as normal amounts of cAMP- stimulated protein kinase activity. Phosphodiesterase in CF cells was also found to be stimulated by cAMP to the same degree as in normal cells. These findings suggest that there is no detectable protein kinase deficiency in CF cells. cf cells thus appear to be unlike some cAMP-resistant mutants described by others which are defective in protein kinase activity and cAMP regulation of phosphodiesterase levels.

It is proposed that larger amounts of polycations increase viscosity and, in excess, cause mucus to become a polycation.

Similarly, the concentration of either cells or fibres correlated significantly with total DNA but not with viscosity.

Tracheobronchial mucus is produced by mucous bronchial glands and goblet cells. This mucus represents at physiological condition about 5 micrometer thick cover on mucous of nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi up to terminal bronchioles. Protective function of mucus cover resposes in mechanical and humoral barrier and also in removing the inhaled particles and their transport to the upper part of the respiratory system.

Seven were off antibiotics, ten on oral cloxacillin, and six on i.v. triple therapy (cloxacillin, gentamycin, and carbenicillin) for at least 2 weeks.  Controls had lower concentrations (milligrams per gram dry stool) of both fat (P < 0.005) and vile acids (P < 0.025) than CF children off antibiotics. Antibiotics had little or no effect on fat but led to a striking decrease (P < 0.01) of bile acids in the triple therapy group. Concomitantly, there was reduced deconjugation of bile acids (P < 0.01) and formation of secondary bile acids (P < 0.005).  This was associated with a 5-fold increase in the percentage of bile acids found in the aqueous phase of stools and with a marked reduction (P < 0.001) of the anaerobic flora (log counts per gram wet stool) in children on triple therapy (4.3 plus or minus 1.9) when compared to controls (9.8 plus or minus 0.1), CF off antibiotics (9.1 plus or minus 0.1) and CF on cloxacillin (9.6 plus or minus 0.2).  The close relationship between the anaerobic flora, the extent of bile acid microbial transformation, and fecal bile acid concentrations suggest that reduction of the anaerobic flora decreases adsorption of bile acids to dietary residues and microbes, favors bile acid absorption, and leads to a decreased fecal loss of bile acids in CF.',\n",

In this report we describe 75 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 18 to 47 years and review another 232 cases reported in the literature.  All of these 307 patients had elevated sweat chloride and sodium levels, which proved excellent discriminants for cystic fibrosis even in patients in the older age group.  COPD, present in 97 per cent, was the major cause of morbidity and mortality, and differed from COPD of other etiologies.  The progressive downhill course in these patients was punctuated by recurrent symptomatic exacerbations of chronic bacterial bronchitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphyloccocus aureus, and terminated in pulmonary insufficiency, cor pulmonale and death.  COPD was complicated by minor hemoptysis in 60 per cent, massive hemoptysis in 7 per cent and pneumothorax in 16 per cent, problems rare in children.  Sinusitis was present in all those examined roentgenographically, and 48 per cent had nasal polyposis.  Pancreatic insufficiency was present in 95 per cent of the patients, but in contrast to younger patients it was seldom symptomatic although steatorrhea and azotorrhea were still massive. Intussusception and meconium ileus equivalent (fecal accumulation) are frequent in adults (21 per cent) but rare in children, and they require immediate diagnostic and therapeutic intervention with enemas of diatrizoate sodium.

The doses of atropine sulfate and isoproterenol hydrochloride were based on published dose-response characteristics of the drugs.  Each day, thoracic gas volume and airway resistance were measured in a volume displacement body plethysmograph, and maximal expiratory flow-volume curves were performed before and at 15, 30, and 60 min after the inhalation. After inhalation of saline, group mean values for all pulmonary functions indicated greater airway obstruction at 15, 30, and 60 min when compared to pretreatment values.  After inhalation of isoproterenol and atropine, significant improvement (P < 0.05) was noted in maximal expiratory flows at 60 per cent of total lung capacity, specific airway conductance, thoracic gas volume, and residual volume.  Inhalation of atropine also significantly improved maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of vital capacity. Isoproterenol increased the mean flows by 8 to 46 per cent above baseline, and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 11 to 16 per cent with the maximal response at 15 or 30 min. Atropine increased mean flows by 15 to 77 per cent and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 16 to 25 per cent with the maximal effect at 30 to 60 min.  The mean response to atropine, expressed as a percentage of baseline, was always greater than or equal to that for isoproterenol.  We conclude that vagal tone, which may reflect increased irritant receptor activity, contributes to the obstructive pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis.  Inhalation of atropine sulfate will decrease the pulmonary function abnormality, but side effects prohibit its clinical usefulness.',\n",
